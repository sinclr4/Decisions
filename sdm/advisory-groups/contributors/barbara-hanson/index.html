    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I have been a Midwife for 22 years and a Bereavement Counsellor for 12 years. Most of midwifery career has been in the area of Fetal Medicine and antenatal services. In 2000 whilst working in Fetal Medicine I was seconded to work within the Bereavement Counselling Services. This service was initially set up by a retired Professor of Fetal Medicine for families who have had a stillbirth or neonatal death. During this time I completed my Diploma in Counselling. Through natural expansion of a needs-led service, there are now six main areas of referral within the multidisciplinary team and include, but are not limited to, all pregnancy loss irrespective of gestational age, complications with an on-going pregnancy where addition support is requested, anticipatory grief and fertility issues</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">At present I work part time as a Midwife in Fetal Medicine and part time as a Bereavement Counsellor. Both roles are challenging and emotional and require excellent communication skills and advanced counselling skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have also undertaken a Diploma in Bereavement Counselling, a Certificate in Anticipatory Grief and I am in the process of completing a Certificate in Counselling Supervision.</span></p>    </div>
