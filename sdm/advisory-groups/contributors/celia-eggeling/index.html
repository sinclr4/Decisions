    <p>I qualified as a social worker in 1980 and worked as a local authority generic social worker until 1986 when I transferred over to the S.W.Thames Renal Unit, which is where I still practice. Recognising the adjustments patients and families have to make to integrate renal replacement therapies into their lives, and the lack of psychological support available, I trained as a psychotherapist gaining a Doctorate in Psychotherapy in 2002.</p>
<p>My publications are :</p>
<p>2010 - Supportive Care for Renal Patients - OUP<br />2007 - End of Life Care in Nephrology - OUP<br />2007 - Palliative Care in Nephrology - Nephrology, Dialysis and<br />Transplantation<br />2003 - Psychological Care in Advanced Renal Care.<br />1999 - Psychological Implications of Living Kidney Donation - BJRM/EDTNA</p>    </div>
