    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I have been a midwife for 25 years having had a variable and enjoyable career. I have also worked as a Health Visitor and School Nurse. The majority of my career has been in the area of Fetal Medicine and Antenatal screening for fetal abnormalities. My current role as Antenatal screening midwife (Job-share for past 4 years) involves informing women of an increase in risk for Down&rsquo;s syndrome and supporting parents in making difficult decisions around testing for abnormalities and the implications involved. This is an emotional and challenging role requiring advanced communication skills and a great deal of empathy and a client centred approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In addition to Down&rsquo;s syndrome screening the role involves coordination of care for women with positive results from the Infectious Diseases and Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Antenatal Screening Programmes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have recently undertaken a Research Post atNewcastleUniversity(one day per week) assisting on a Qualitative Study with aim of developing a tool to support midwives in the implementation of NICE Obesity guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have a certificate in Counselling and a degree in Public Health.</span></p>    </div>
