    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Claire Leader is a Senior Research Midwife at the Newcastle Upon Tyne hospitals foundation trust. Since 2010 she has led the Reproductive Health research team in coordinating and facilitating studies adopted by the National Institute for Health Research which aim to ultimately improve the standard of care received by women and their babies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Claire&rsquo;s main research interests are around choice and decision making in the context of pregnancy and women&rsquo;s health. She was the lead midwife for a large scale implementation study called MAGIC (Making Good decisions in collaboration), a Health Foundation supported study which sought to explore the implementation of shared decision making in clinical practice. The obstetric component of the project included decisions regarding place of birth, combined screening for fetal anomalies, External Cephalic Version and the decision regarding mode of delivery following a previous caesarean section. This latter choice was the focus of Claire&rsquo;s dissertation for the MA in Sociology and Social Research (for which she was awarded a distinction). The project was an exploration of the relationship between pregnant women and health care professionals and the impact of this upon the decision making process. Claire has presented her work on shared decision making at the British Maternal and Fetal Medicine Society conference in Glasgow in 2012 and at the Nursing &amp; Midwifery conference 2012 in Newcastle Upon Tyne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Since qualifying as a midwife, Claire has remained passionate about ensuring that women&rsquo;s choice is facilitated and supported within contemporary maternity services and that health care provision is tailored to meet the needs of individual women and their families to ensure they receive the best possible care. She plans to continue her efforts in improving choice and decision making through the development of good quality research and by working collaboratively with midwives and clinicians alike towards this endeavour.</span></p>
