    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I qualified as a Registered Nurse ( Adult branch ) from Leeds College of Health in 1996. </span><span style="font-size: small;">After spells working in Day Surgery, Maxillo-Facial, General &amp; Ophthalmic Theatres, I joined the Dermatology Department at Harrogate District Hospital in August 2004. </span><span style="font-size: small;">I divide my time between working as a staff nurse in Dermatology &amp; as a research nurse for acne &amp; psoriasis studies. </span><span style="font-size: small;">I help recruit for an acne genetics study &amp; also treat patients , who require hyfrecation for macrocomedomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For the last 7 years I have been involved in a study " improved baseline assessments in acne " , whereby I see new referrals in order to aid treatment outcomes &amp; to compile a database to help find out more about the causes &amp; consequences of acne &amp; how best to treat it. We currently have over 1200 patients on the database.</span></p>    </div>
