    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Dr Lane received a BSc (Hons) in Psychology from the University of Liverpool in 1995 and a PhD from the University of Birmingham in 2000. She is currently a Lecturer in Cardiovascular Health at the University of Birmingham Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust. Dr Lane&rsquo;s main research interest is atrial fibrillation, particularly how atrial fibrillation affects quality of life and psychological well-being, patient education, and patients&rsquo; perceptions of the condition. She is currently the principal investigator of a randomised controlled trial [TREAT- ISCRTN93952605] comparing intensive education with usual care in AF patients newly referred for oral anticoagulation, to examine the impact of education on patients&rsquo; knowledge and perceptions of AF and its treatment, and INR control. In addition, she is involved in refining stroke and bleeding risk stratification of AF patients; she is a co-author of both the CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk stratification schema and HAS-BLED bleeding risk schema which are widely used both nationally and internationally in clinical practice. She is also a member of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation patients (9th edition, 2012) and the European Heart Rhythm Association Task Force on bleeding risk assessment in atrial fibrillation. She has published her work widely in journals such as Stroke, JACC, Chest, Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Psychosomatic Medicine, Journal of Psychosomatic Research and Heart.</span></p>    </div>
