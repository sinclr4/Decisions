    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I was born in Montevideo Uruguay but have been in the UK from the age of 11 years. I went to a local grammar school in Dorset before undertaking my medical degree in Birmingham. I pursued a training in cardiology at St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital London, then Oxford before being appointed as a consultant cardiologist at University College Hospital London, with an honorary clinical lecturer appointment at University College London. In 1990 I founded the Hatter Cardiovascular Institute at UCH with the help of a non-clinical colleague. This Institute now has a staff of over 30 and an international reputation in laboratory basic science through to the co-ordination of international trials of clinical translational research.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">My clinical commitments include the provision of cardiology services and interventional treatments, such as angioplasty and stents, to adult patients with heart disease. These are undertaken at the Heart Hospital, now part of UCH. I have particular interests in cardiovascular health and rehabilitation and I am the consultant lead for these services for this Trust. For a number of years I was the treasurer then president of the British Association of Cardiovascular Rehabilitation.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">I have developed a particular clinical expertise in the cardiovascular consequences of inherited disorders of the blood (specifically the thalassaemias and sickle cell anaemia) and have an international reputation in this highly specialised area of cardiovascular medicine. I am on the scientific boards of the national and international bodies that support thalassaemia patients (UKTS and TIF).</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;">I have made a major contribution to more than 60 articles that have been published in medical and scientific journals and numerous book chapters, including authorship of the cardiovascular disease chapters of a major English language textbook of medicine.</span></p>    </div>
