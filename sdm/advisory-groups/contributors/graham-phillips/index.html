    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I have a special interest in Pharmacy and Public Health, Men&rsquo;s health in particular. I am involved in the steering group on a DH-sponsored project looking at increasing Men&rsquo;s use of Community Pharmacy (due to be published later this year)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I had significant input into the DH &ldquo;Public Health Through Pharmacy&rdquo; document in which my model pharmacy in Letchworth, Herts, is heavily featured (DH, 2006)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Involved in DH Lung Cancer Awareness Month Working Group. The work of this group was one of the exemplars in DH White Paper, Pharmacy in England (2008)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Our group of pharmacies works closely with the School of Pharmacy, University of Hatfield. Currently working to establish a model for a &ldquo;Teaching Pharmacy&rdquo; which we believe will be crucial to implementation of &ldquo;Pharmacy in England&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I am one of a the research team, working with Herts PCT, the University f Hertfordshire School of Pharmacy and the post-graduate medical school in a trial to establish the value of intensive interventions by community pharmacists in patients with &ldquo;metabolic syndrome&rdquo;. This project, due to complete in late 2010, was runner up, PJ Care Awards, 2009.</span></p>
