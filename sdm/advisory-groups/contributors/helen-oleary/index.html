    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Helen qualified as a Registered Nurse in 1996. In 2000 she joined the Cardiac Rehabilitation team, at Nevill Hall Hospital Monmouthshire, on an 18 month secondment - and has never left! In 2002 she joined the team on a permanent basis as an Angina Clinical Nurse Specialist and established a stand alone Cardiac Rehabilitation service for patients with a primary diagnosis of Angina. She has a BSc Hons in Cardiac Nursing from Cardiff University and has just completed her Post Graduate Diploma in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy from the University of Wales. She was a member of the NICE stable angina guideline development group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Angina Cardiac Rehabilitation service has now merged with the generic Cardiac Rehabilitation service ensuring a robust service provision for patients with Coronary Artery Disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">She is looking forward to the challenge of incorporating her new CBT skills into the existing Cardiac Rehabilitation service.</span></p>    </div>
