    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I am a Consultant Clinical Neurophysiologist based at theSt Helensand Knowsley Teaching hospitals NHS Trust. I received my training at theWaltonCentreFoundationHospital,Liverpooland am a Consultant since 2006.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have a special interest in peripheral nerve disorders, particularly peripheral entrapment neuropathies &ndash; including carpal tunnel syndrome. I work closely with Orthopaedic surgeons, Plastic / Reconstructive surgeons and Rhuematologists who manage hand problems. I provide diagnostic support in patients suspected to have carpal tunnel syndrome by performing some simple tests called the Nerve Conduction Studies. The tests involve electrically evoked studies of the median nerve at the wrist to assess for any nerve compression within the carpal tunnel.</span></p>    </div>
