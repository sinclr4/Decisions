    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Matt Fay was a Leeds Medical School graduate, graduating in 1992, very much to the dean&rsquo;s surprise. He enjoyed a varied few years in hospital practice as was permitted by junior doctor training of the time before becoming a General Practitioner at Westcliffe Medical Practice in 1999, which has practices in Shipley, Thornton and Denholme on the Bradford Area. In 2001 Matt established a GPwSI cardiology service for North Bradford PCT with his friend and colleague Andreas Wolff. He took this under the Westcliffe Medical Practice control and expanded the services to local people in 2006 and established a further locality service in Ilkley in 2010 and Queensbury in 2011. Matt is currently the National Clinical Lead for Atrial Fibrillation for NHS Improvement Heart, an Executive of the Atrial Fibrillation Association, STARS (the Syncope Trust) and the Arrhythmia Alliance. He is passionate about shifting the paradigm of the prevention of AF related stroke from clinician suggested anti-platelet agents to patient directed use of anticoagulant therapy. He is working within the changes of the NHS, being an executive of the Bradford Districts Clinical Commissioning Group with a portfolio of Innovation and Long Term Conditions and Innovation. First and foremost he is a general practitioner spending the majority of his time seeing people in that setting</span></p>
