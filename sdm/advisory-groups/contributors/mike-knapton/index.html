    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Dr Mike Knapton joined the BHF in January 2006, from a clinical background. He trained as a GP at Cambridge University, and has significant experience in Primary Care roles, especially working with heart patients. In 2002, he was elected Chairman of the Cambridge City Primary Care Trust (PCT) Professional Executive Committee, before becoming the combined PCTs&rsquo; Medical Director in 2004. Mike has continued to serve as a GP one day every week since joining the BHF, as he believes it&rsquo;s important to have frontline experience of working with patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As Associate Director (Prevention and Care) at the BHF, Mike is responsible for initiating innovative programmes for all people at risk of, or affected by, heart disease, and leads the charity&rsquo;s efforts to prevent avoidable heart disease, save lives and maximise recovery and quality of life. He is also a much sought-after spokesperson in media work for the BHF&rsquo;s health campaigns.</span></p>    </div>
