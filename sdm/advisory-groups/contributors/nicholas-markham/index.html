    <p>Nicholas Markham qualified from St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital London in 1977. Following surgical training in Oxford and Cambridge, he studied for an MS thesis at The Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research in Cambridge.   After Senior Registrar training in Cardiff, he was appointed Lecturer in Surgery at the Royal Free Hospital London in 1988. He spent a year as Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Surgery at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1989/90, before returning to London for a brief spell and then being appointed Consultant Surgeon at The North Devon District Hospital in 1992.   He introduced the techniques of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hernia repair and colectomy to the Trust and became heavily involved in surgical education, firstly as Royal College of Surgeons Tutor, then as Programme Director for the South West Higher Surgical Training Programme. In 2006 he was appointed as Head of the South West Peninsula School of Surgery, a post he held until 2011.  In clinical practice his other passion is trying to improve patient communication and he has been responsible for the introduction of a range of information leaflets, and now DVDs, in his Trust.
