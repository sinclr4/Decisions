    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Nick is responsible for co-ordinating patient information and stakeholder engagement across all 8 of the NHS Screening Programmes (except for the cancer programmes, which are run separately). He also runs the press office and manages the screening websites. Part of his role is to raise public awareness of screening and its considerable benefits but also potential limitations and downsides, with the aim of ensuring that people can always make well informed choices about what screening tests are right for them. Before working for the UK NSC, Nick was with the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme for 7 years, helping to implement it across England. Prior to that, Nick worked in mental health research. He studied Psychology and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Birmingham.</span></p>    </div>
