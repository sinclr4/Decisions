    <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Phil has enjoyed a successful career in public health and sports development &ndash; where he has a track record of creating and scaling high impact strategies and subsequent programmes for local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Often originating as raw ideas and concepts the strategies are built to last, have sometimes led to systemic change, and include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">&bull; A &lsquo;whole systems&rsquo; strategy to tackling obesity - &lsquo;Building Powerful Communities&rsquo; - in partnership with Bupa, the Tower Hamlets public health team and MEND that influenced up to 6,000 local residents to adopt healthier eating habits and become more physically active. Expanding to 5 cities in Scotland in 2013-14</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">&bull; The community sport element of the National School Sport Strategy, including &lsquo;Sport Unlimited&rsquo;, for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Education, a &pound;36m project that attracted 900,000 &lsquo;unsporty&rsquo; young people into sport in a three-year period &ndash; and is now a major 2012 Olympic legacy programme</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">&bull; The Young People strategy, including the National Mini Tennis Programme, for the Lawn Tennis Association - that is now the way in which children are introduced to and learn the sport globally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Phil has a range of strengths including developing effective partnerships &ndash; At MEND he broadened the roll out of the MEND programme range by working with a new range of partners including the Dame Kelly Holmes Legacy Trust, The Aviva Premiership (Rugby Union), Benendon Health Care Society, and the Institute of Health Equity. He is a current member of the Responsibility Deal Taskforce - &lsquo;Physical Activity for Young People&rsquo; (Department of Health).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He speaks regularly on issues around obesity, physical activity, creating more active environments, and sports participation. Examples include: delivering a keynote panel response to the publication of the &lsquo;Marmot Review&rsquo; at the Westminster Health Forum Seminar on Health Inequalities in February 2010, chairing and delivering the keynote session at the &lsquo;Childhood Health Fit for the Future&rsquo; Conference at the Barbican (May 2010), appearing in a Lib Dem fringe conference panel to discuss obesity with Paul Bairstow (Minister for Social Care) in October 2010, taking part in the &lsquo;Society Guardian&rsquo; debate on childhood obesity (November 2010), appearing on the BBC breakfast sofa to discuss childhood obesity (December 2010), keynote speaker at an All Party Parliamentary Group on sport and public health (June 2011), and keynote speaker to the Conservative Muslims Forum in House of Lords (June 2012). He also appeared in an interview in &lsquo;Children and Young People Now&rsquo; magazine in July 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He has an insatiable innovative approach to his work. In February 2012 for example he led a randomly assembled team to win a &pound;10k one-day competition from NHS London to develop an idea utilising technology to encourage young people to adopt healthier lifestyles www.sicamp.org/?s=beehive).</span></p>
