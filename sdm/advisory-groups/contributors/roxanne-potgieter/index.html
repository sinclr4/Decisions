    <p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I graduated with a First Class BSc (HONS) Psychology degree in 2009 from the University of West England, Bristol. I have since been working as Project Manager on the Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Quality Improvement Programme (AAAQIP) on behalf of the Vascular Society. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">The AAAQIP was funded through the Health Foundation and the &lsquo;Closing the Gap through Clinical Communities&rsquo; programme and aimed to reduce mortality after elective AAA repair to 3.5% or less by 2013. One of the primary workstreams I took the lead in, was to engage and collaborate with patients to improve informed consent, communication throughout the care pathway and patient satisfaction. A network of patient groups was built around the UK (Bristol, Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester, Aberdeen, Cardiff and London) to explore patient experiences and to identify areas for improvement. We identified a national deficit in post-operative recovery information. The effects of EVAR &amp; OR procedures were underestimated. Many patients reported that they face unexpected consequences from AAA surgery. This leads to anxiousness about their recovery. I fed this information into the Patient Decision Aid development to clarify treatment options, highlighting risks and benefits and any areas of uncertainty. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">As part of the AAAQIP we integrated a number of changes to address the gaps in communication: </span></p>
<ol start="1">
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Specifically tailored patient information leaflets (including treatment options, impact on Qol, complications, medication, pain relief and follow up). The patient information leaflets were developed in collaboration with patients and tested through our focus groups.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Standardised the informed consent process. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Ensured patients are provided with a point of contact post-operatively to address concerns.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Integrated telephone follow up to address patient and carer issues early in the post-operative period.</span></li>
</ol>
