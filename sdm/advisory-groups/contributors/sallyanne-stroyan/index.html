<p><span style="font-size: small;">Antenatal and Newborn Screening Specialist Midwife</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">RGN, RM, BSc (Hons),</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have been qualified as a midwife for 22 years having previously been a senior nurse in the field of cardiac transplantation. I have been senior midwife in a regional tertiary referral fetal medicine unit in the North East of England for 10 years and am currently a local screening co-ordinator / specialist midwife with responsibility for the coordination of NHS antenatal and newborn screening programmes within the Trust consistent with UK National Screening Committee recommendations (UK NSC) and national programme standards. As a member of a Shared Decision Making steering group my clinical skills and experience have informed the development, implementation and embedding of shared decision making within clinical practice.</span></p>    </div>
