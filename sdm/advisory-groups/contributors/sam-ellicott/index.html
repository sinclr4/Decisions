    <p><span style="font-size: small;">In November 2010 I was driving my car whilst listening to a local&nbsp;radio programme on which was featured an interview with a local&nbsp;Consultant Vascular Surgeon and the subject being discussed was</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">the introduction of a local screening programme for men at age&nbsp;of 65 who would be receiving a letter on their birthday. I was&nbsp;only giving slight attention to the interview but I do remember&nbsp;that the interviewer pointed out that he was nearer 70 and would&nbsp;therefore not receive a letter. This applied to me also and so, when&nbsp;a telephone number for the local screening service was given out,&nbsp;I made a note and rang the office the next day. An ultrasound scan&nbsp;was arranged for the next week and I was found to have a large&nbsp;abdominal aortic aneurysm &ndash; 6.5cm. I was seen by a Consultant&nbsp;two days later and an open surgical repair was performed in early&nbsp;December 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I firmly believe that this prompt action saved my life and therefore&nbsp;I am eager to assist in any way possible to spread the word about&nbsp;the screening programme and encourage men to take that essential&nbsp;decision to attend for screening and not hesitate. If I had hesitated I may not have had such a happy and successful outcome.</span></p>        <h3>RELATED LINKS</h3>
