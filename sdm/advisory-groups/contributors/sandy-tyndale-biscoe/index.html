    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Sandy Tyndale-Biscoe is a retired naval engineer and IT consultant, who was diagnosed with, and treated for, prostate cancer in 2001, at the age of 57. He is the Chairman of the Prostate Cancer Support Federation, the umbrella organisation for nearly 50 patient-led prostate cancer support groups, spread throughout the UK, which has members numbering over 7,000 patients. He represents patients on the Department of Health&rsquo;s Prostate Cancer Advisory Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Sandy is alive today and able to enjoy his hobbies of amateur drama, sailing and pottery, thanks to the advice given 12 years ago, by a friend, sadly now deceased, to have his PSA checked.</span></p>    </div>
