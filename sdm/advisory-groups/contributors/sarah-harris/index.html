I trained at the Whittington Hospital in North London and have worked at the Royal Free Hospital and at the Middlesex Hospital in Central London. I have always worked in Urology since qualifying and have been a Uro-Oncology Nurse Specialist for fourteen years now. I transferred to Addenbrookes in 2003 and have continued to specialise in urological cancers.</span></p>
