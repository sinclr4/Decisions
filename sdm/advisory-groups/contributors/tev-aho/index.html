    <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Tev is a New Zealander but has lived in the UK since 2003 when he completed a Fellowship in Uro-oncology. He was appointed as a consultant Urologist at Addenbrookes Hospital, the Cambridge Nuffield Hospital, and the Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital in Cambridge in 2004. He completed most of his urological training in New Zealand where he learned the technique of Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) from the NZ urologists who invented the procedure, and was involved in some of the early HoLEP clinical trials. Tev has one of the largest experiences of HoLEP in the UK (more than 850 cases). He also has an interest in training other urologists in HoLEP and has mentored colleagues and performed live HoLEP surgery demonstrations throughout the UK and abroad. He convenes an annual HoLEP training meeting in Cambridge each year and was the inaugural president of the UK Holmium User Group. His other main clinical interest is kidney surgery.</span></p>
