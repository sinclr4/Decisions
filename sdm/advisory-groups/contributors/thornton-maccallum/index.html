    <p><span style="font-size: small;">I have been a Principal in General Practice at Rowcroft Medical Centre in Stroud for 26 years. I have been a Hospital Practitioner in General Surgery and Urology at Stroud General Hospital for the same length of time. I have an interest in Men&rsquo;s Health, particularly in the preventative aspects. We, as Health Professionals need to advocate shared decision-making and encourage the individual to take responsibility for his or her health by informing them of their choices and treatment options.</span></p>    </div>
