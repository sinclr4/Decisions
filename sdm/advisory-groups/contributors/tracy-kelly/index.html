    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Tracy Kelly is the Head of Care at Diabetes UK. Having worked as a specialist dietitian and coach, Tracy has seen the benefits of supporting and enabling people to be actively involved in their care. She recognises the need to make healthcare more person-centred and is committed to drive change which will benefit people with diabetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;I believe that patient decision aids are powerful tools which encouragepeople (with diabetes) and clinicians to have more meaningful and informed discussions resulting in everyone working together to find solutions which work.&rdquo;</span></p>
