    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong></strong>I studied Medicine in Cambridge and Oxford, and trained in Surgery and Urology in Oxford, Switzerland and Yorkshire. I trained broadly in general urology, and have specialist training in the management of bladder cancer. I have been a Consultant Urologist at Addenbrooke&rsquo;s Hospital since 1999. Our Bladder Oncology team serves as one of the two specialist bladder cancer teams for the Anglia Cancer Network. We offer BCG treatment, and removal of the bladder (cystectomy) and all forms of urinary diversion (ileal conduit, bladder substitution and catheterisable reservoirs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We are working with our patients to improve information about our services so that patients will be better informed about their condition and how it can be treated. This is being done in web-based format and on DVD, together with a patient forum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have chaired the local and specialist Urology cancer multidisciplinary teams, and have been co-chair of the Urology group of the Anglia Cancer Network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I am currently clinical lead for the NICE Bladder Cancer Guideline Development Group, and I have been a member of a NICE Technology Appraisal Committee, and of the NICE Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Guideline Development Group, the European Association of Urology Incontinence Guideline Group, and the International Consultation in Urological Diseases 2012 Bladder Cancer consultation.</span></p>    </div>
