                <div data-cms-content-id="37_1_further-info_157"><p>As you get older, the wall of your aorta can become weak, causing it to balloon outwards and form a bulge. The bulge is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Most aneurysms develop in the lower part of the aorta below the kidneys. The condition is most common in men aged 65 and older. You might also hear it called AAA or triple A.</p>
<p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to get larger over time. Most grow slowly but some can increase in size quite suddenly.</p>
<p>If an aneurysm is small when it is detected, it may never grow big enough to cause problems. But large aneurysms can be dangerous. If the wall of the aorta gets very weak it might burst, causing massive internal bleeding. This can be fatal.</p>
<p>An aneurysm is considered large if it is at least 5.5 centimetres wide at its largest point. When an aneurysm reaches this size, surgery is usually recommended. This is because, at this size, the risk of rupture is usually higher than the risk from surgery.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Moll FL, Powell JT, Fraedrich G, et al.

It involves putting an artificial piece of artery, called a stent graft, inside your aorta to carry blood through the weakened section. The idea is to strengthen the part of the aorta with the aneurysm.</p>
<p>A surgeon makes small cuts in your groin at the top of your legs to reach large blood vessels. The graft is attached to a thin tube (a catheter). With the help of X-rays, the catheter guides the graft through the blood vessels and into the aneurysm. When the graft is in the right place, it is fastened with small hooks or pins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Endovascular&rsquo; means the surgery is done through your blood vessels. You may sometimes hear endovascular aneurysm repair called EVAR for short.</p>
<p>You may have a general anaesthetic, so that you will be asleep during the operation. Or, you might have a regional or local anaesthetic plus sedation. This means you will be relaxed but awake during the surgery. You will not be able to feel the area being operated on.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-50">50</span>]<span id="reference-50" class="content-reference">Winterborn RJ, Amin I, Lyratzopoulos G,et al. Preferences for endovascular (EVAR) or open surgical repair among patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms under surveillance. Journal of Vascular Surgery. 2009; 49: 576-581.</span></p>
<p>After the operation, you will have regular scans to check on your aneurysm. This is to look for leaks around the graft and to make sure the graft is working properly and still in place.&nbsp;You will most likely have ultrasound scans, but in some hospitals you may have a CT scan instead (CT is short for computerised tomography).</p>
<p>You will probably have a scan six weeks, six months and a year after surgery, and then annually after that.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-51">51</span>]<span id="reference-51" class="content-reference">Department of Vascular Surgery.

<p>Your blood vessels need to be a right size and shape for the operation. This is important so the graft can make a tight seal to prevent blood from leaking. If the aneurysm is too close to the blood vessels going to the kidneys, the operation could block the blood flow to these organs. Some people&rsquo;s blood vessels are too narrow to allow the graft to be passed up to the aneurysm. Endovascular repair is an option for about half of people with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-52">52</span>]<span id="reference-52" class="content-reference">EVAR trial participants. Endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 1): randomised controlled trial. Lancet 2005; 365: 2179-2186.</span></p>
<p>You must also be healthy enough to have the operation and benefit from it. If you have other serious health conditions, the operation may not help you live longer. So, it may not be worth the risks. Your age alone is unlikely to make a difference to whether you can choose endovascular repair.</p></div>

<p><strong>Problems during or soon after the operation</strong></p>
<p>There is a chance of infection, bleeding and reactions to the anaesthetic with endovascular repair. It&rsquo;s also possible to have a heart attack, stroke or breathing problems because of the surgery.</p>
<p>During the operation, there&rsquo;s a chance that your aorta might be damaged, which could lead to the aneurysm bursting.</p>
<p>If there are problems during surgery, your surgeon may need to switch to an open repair. This is a bigger operation.

<p>It's quite common to find that you have problems with bowel movements in the period after your surgery. You may also find that you lose your appetite, which can lead to you losing weight. The wounds in the groin where the graft was put in may also take time to heal properly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get problems with the blood flow to your bowel, kidneys, or legs after endovascular surgery. These problems aren&rsquo;t common but they can be serious.</p>
<p>If you are a man, you might also have problems getting an erection or having sex soon after surgery. This often improves within six weeks.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-48">48</span>]<span id="reference-48" class="content-reference">Prinssen M, Buskens E, Tutein Nolthenius RP, et al.

<p><strong>Problems related to the graft</strong></p>
<p>These problems can happen soon after surgery or long after. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endoleaks. These are blood leaks between the graft and the wall of the aorta. Small blood vessels within the aneurysm wall can also leak. Endoleaks can cause the aneurysm to continue to grow and rupture.</li>
<li>The graft moving, becoming blocked, or breaking down. The graft may also become infected.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need long-term follow-up with regular scans to check on your aneurysm, look for leaks around the graft and make sure it is working properly and still in place. If a problem is found, you may need another operation. This could be an endovascular operation or open surgery.</p>

<p>At any time, you may decide to have surgery to repair your aneurysm. Or, you may continue to have surveillance long term.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ultrasound is to check whether your aneurysm is growing and how quickly. The larger your aneurysm becomes, the more likely it is to rupture. You also have a higher risk of rupture if your aneurysm is growing rapidly &ndash; for example, at a rate of more than 1 centimetre a year.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-72">72</span>]<span id="reference-72" class="content-reference">Nordon IM, Hinchliffe RJ, Loftus IM, et al.

<p>You might decide in advance that you&rsquo;ll have surgery if your aneurysm reaches a certain size, or has a certain rate of growth. Or, you may want to weigh your risk of rupture against the risks of surgery each time you have a scan.</p>
<p>While having surveillance, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes and treatments to help slow the growth of your aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stopping smoking</strong>. Smoking is linked to faster aneurysm growth, but quitting smoking can make a difference. Former smokers have an aneurysm growth rate that is similar to non-smokers&rsquo;.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-22">22</span>]<span id="reference-22" class="content-reference">Brady AR, Thompson SG, Fowkes FG, et al. Abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion: risk factors and time intervals for surveillance. Circulation. 2004; 110: 16-21.</span></li>
<li><strong>Taking regular exercise</strong>. Moderate exercise is safe for people with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Exercise may play a role in slowing aneurysm growth, although we need more research to be sure. However, we do know exercise is good for your heart and blood flow in other ways and may lower your blood pressure. Taking regular exercise may also mean you&rsquo;ll be more fit for surgery should you decide to have your aneurysm repaired. This may lower your risk of problems from the operation and shorten your recovery time.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-75">75</span>]<span id="reference-75" class="content-reference">Kothmann E, Batterham AM, Owen SJ, et al.

<li><strong>Taking other steps to improve your health</strong>. Adopting a healthier lifestyle can improve your health outlook in general, and may help you live longer. Try to eat a heart-healthy, low-fat diet that includes lots of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. If you are overweight, try to lose weight. And make sure you take any medicines that your doctor has prescribed, such as treatments for high blood pressure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Several medicines have been studied as possible treatments to slow aneurysm growth, including some types of antibiotics and drugs that decrease inflammation in the body. Most of these are still considered experimental. You may be offered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statins</strong>: These are drugs that reduce your cholesterol. Some studies suggest that taking statins may also slow aneurysm growth.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-77">77</span>]<span id="reference-77" class="content-reference">Golledge J, Norman PE. Current status of medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerosis. 2011; 217: 57-63.</span></li>
<li><strong>Aspirin</strong>: Aspirin is often referred to as a &lsquo;blood thinning&rsquo; drug, as it makes your blood less likely to clot. Many people take aspirin each day to help prevent their blood from clotting and blocking blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Some research suggests aspirin might also play a role in slowing aneurysm growth, although not all studies have found this.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-77">77</span>]<span id="reference-77" class="content-reference">Golledge J, Norman PE. Current status of medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerosis. 2011; 217: 57-63.</span></li>
<li><strong>Blood pressure drugs</strong>: Many different types of drugs are used to reduce your blood pressure, if it is too high. These include beta blockers, diuretics and ACE inhibitors.</li>

<p><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stopping smoking</strong>. Smoking is linked to faster aneurysm growth, but quitting smoking can make a difference. Former smokers have a growth rate that is similar to non-smokers&rsquo;.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-22">22</span>]<span id="reference-22" class="content-reference">Brady AR, Thompson SG, Fowkes FG, et al. Abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion: risk factors and time intervals for surveillance. Circulation. 2004; 110: 16-21.</span></li>
<li><strong>Taking regular exercise</strong>. Moderate exercise is safe for people with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Exercise may play a role in slowing aneurysm growth, although we need more research to be sure. We do know exercise is good for your heart and blood flow in other ways and may lower your blood pressure. Taking regular exercise may also mean you&rsquo;ll be more fit for surgery should you decide to have your aneurysm repaired. This may lower your risk of problems from the operation and shorten your recovery time.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-89">89</span>]<span id="reference-89" class="content-reference">Kothmann E, Batterham AM, Owen SJ, et al.

<li><strong>Taking other steps to improve your health</strong>. Adopting a healthier lifestyle will improve your health outlook in general, and may help you live longer. Try to eat a heart-healthy, low-fat diet that includes lots of fruit, vegetables and whole grains. If you are overweight, try to lose weight. And make sure you take any medicines that your doctor has prescribed, such as treatments for high blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Several medicines have been studied as possible treatments to slow aneurysm growth, including some types of antibiotics and drugs that decrease inflammation in the body. Most of these are still considered experimental. You may be offered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statins</strong>: These are drugs that reduce your cholesterol. Some studies suggest that taking statins may also slow aneurysm growth.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-77">77</span>]<span id="reference-77" class="content-reference">Golledge J, Norman PE. Current status of medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerosis. 2011; 217: 57-63.</span></li>
<li><strong>Aspirin</strong>: Aspirin is often referred to as a &lsquo;blood thinning&rsquo; drug, as it makes your blood less likely to clot. Many people take aspirin each day to help prevent their blood from clotting and blocking blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Some research suggests aspirin might also play a role in slowing aneurysm growth, although not all studies have found this.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-77">77</span>]<span id="reference-77" class="content-reference">Golledge J, Norman PE. Current status of medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerosis. 2011; 217: 57-63.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Blood pressure drugs</strong>: Many different types of drugs are used to reduce your blood pressure, if it is too high. These include beta blockers, diuretics and ACE inhibitors.</span></li>
