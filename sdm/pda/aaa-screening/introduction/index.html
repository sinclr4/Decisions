                                            <p>This decision aid is to help men aged 65 and over decide if they want to get screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm, also known as AAA or triple A. It is also for relatives, friends and health professionals who want to know more about AAA screening.</p>
<p>Screening is a process that helps to find apparently healthy people who are at increased risk of a disease or condition so that they can be offered further information, tests and treatment. The UK National Screening Committee supported the launch of the NHS AAA Screening Programme after evidence showed that screening should reduce the number of people who die from abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://aaa.screening.nhs.uk/whereyoulive" target="_blank">NHS AAA Screening Programme </a>invites men in England for screening during the year they turn 65. Men over 65 can contact the Programme to arrange to be screened. Screening is a choice. Men aged 65 and over are therefore faced with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm</li>
<li>Do not get screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm</li>
</ul>
<p>The information in this decision aid can help you understand the advantages and disadvantages of screening, and the possible effects of your decision. Please click on the Continue button at the bottom of each page to work through the decision aid.</p>
<p>If you have a large abdominal aortic aneurysm, we recommend that you read the <a href="../../aaa-repair/index.html" target="_blank">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Decision Aid</a>.</p>                    </div>

                            <p>The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to your body. It runs from your heart down through your chest and abdomen.</p>
<p>As you get older, the wall of the aorta can become weak. It can then expand and develop into what is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm or AAA. The condition is most common in men aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>Large aneurysms can be very serious. The wall of your aorta can get very weak and burst. If this happens, your chance of surviving is about 20 out of 100. Open surgery or endovascular repair surgery are the two most common treatments to repair large aneurysms that are found through screening. 97 to 98 out of every 100 patients survive AAA repair surgery.</p>                        </div>

                            <p>If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm you will not generally notice any symptoms. This means that you cannot tell if you have one, as you will not feel any pain or notice anything different.</p>
<p>The NHS offers screening in order to find aneurysms early so they can be checked regularly or treated if needed. The easiest way to find out if you have an aneurysm is to have an ultrasound (sonar) scan of your abdomen.</p>
<p>You are more likely to have an AAA if you are a man aged 65 or over. That is why the NHS invites all men for screening in the year they become 65. If you are a man over 65 and have not been screened then you can contact your <a href="http://aaa.screening.nhs.uk/whereyoulive" target="_blank">local screening programme </a>to ask for a screening appointment.</p>
<p>The NHS AAA Screening Programme was introduced after research showed it should reduce the number of deaths from burst aneurysms among men aged 65 to 74.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men aged under 65 or women are not eligible for screening but should talk to their GP if they are worried about abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>                        </div>

                            <p>At your appointment, you will see a Screening Technician who is specially trained to carry out the AAA screening test. They will explain the test and you can ask questions.</p>
<p>The Screening Technician will ask for your permission to keep your information on a national computer system. This will include images of your aorta, measurements recorded at the clinic and your answers to questions about your health. Your personal information will only be used by the NHS AAA Screening Programme. It will not be passed on to anyone who is not directly involved in screening or any follow-up treatment required.</p>
<p>The screening test is a simple ultrasound scan that usually takes less than 10 minutes. An ultrasound scan is a procedure that uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. The procedure is completely safe and it does not hurt.</p>
<p>The Screening Technician will ask you to lie down and lift up or unbutton your shirt. You will not need to undress. They will put cool jelly on your abdomen and then move an ultrasound scanner over your skin. The scan will show a picture of the aorta on a monitor and the Screening Technician will be able to measure it. They will tell you your result straight away and they will also tell your doctor.</p>                        </div>

<p>About 35 out of every 1,000 men screened have a small or medium aneurysm.</p>
<p>If you have a small or medium aneurysm you will be invited to come back for regular tests to check if it is getting bigger. The tests will be every year if you have a small aneurysm&nbsp;between 3 and 4.4cm wide and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm&nbsp;between 4.5 and 5.4cm wide.</p>
<p>You will not usually need to come back if several tests in a row show that your small/medium aneurysm is not getting larger.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the risks if I have a small/medium aneurysm?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>If you have a small/medium aneurysm, you will be offered an appointment with a nurse practitioner who will give you advice on what you can do to help stop your aneurysm getting bigger. This will include eating healthy foods, regular exercise and not smoking.</p>
<p>Your own doctor may also give you pills or change your medication. They may also check your blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Can small/medium aneurysms be repaired by an operation?</strong></p>
<p>A repair operation is not recommended for aneurysms less than 5.5cm wide and many small and medium aneurysms never grow to 5.5cm wide or larger. The risk of an aneurysm bursting if it is less than 5.5cm wide is about 1 in 100 per year. This is a smaller risk than the risk of dying following an operation to repair the aneurysm.</p>
<p>However, small and medium aneurysms can become larger over time and grow into large aneurysms 5.5cm wide or larger. If this happens, you will be given an appointment with a surgeon who may recommend an operation.</p>
<p><strong>Can I opt out of regular screening tests?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, screening is your choice. You can opt out of screening at any time.</p>                        </div>

                            <p>If you have a large aneurysm it means that your aorta is much larger than normal &ndash; 5.5cm wide or larger. About 5 out of every 1,000 men screened have a large aneurysm.</p>
<p>If your screening test shows you have a large aneurysm you will be given an appointment with a surgeon who may recommend an operation. Your GP will also be told.</p>
<p>The surgeon will talk to you about treatment options and any risks. They will also give you more tests to find out if you are suitable for surgery and answer any questions you have before you decide what treatment you want.</p>
<p>If you have a large aneurysm, we recommend that you read the <a href="../../aaa-repair/index.html" target="_blank">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Repair Decision Aid</a>. This is designed to help people with large aneurysms decide which treatment option is best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any risks in having an operation?</strong></p>
<p>Operations to repair large aneurysms found by screening are usually successful. About 97 to 98 out of every 100 patients survive the operation.</p>
<p>However, it is a major operation and the main risk is death or heart attack. The risks of surgery depend mainly on your fitness before the operation. 2 to 3 out of every 100 patients are likely to die during or shortly after an operation to repair a large aneurysm.</p>
<p>Full recovery to normal levels of activity may take a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to have an operation if I have a large aneurysm?</strong></p>
<p>No, having an operation is your choice.</p>
<p>For a few men, an operation may have very high risks that outweigh the risks of the aneurysm bursting. This might be if you have other serious health problems.</p>
<p><strong>What are the implications for driving?</strong></p>
<p>For car drivers, the DVLA should be notified when an AAA reaches 6cm in diameter. Once an AAA reaches 6.5cm, the person should stop driving. Drivers of lorries and buses should stop driving once an AAA reaches 5.5cm. Licences are reinstated if an AAA is treated successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Can I do anything to stop an aneurysm getting bigger?</strong></p>
<p>You will be given advice on what you can do to help stop your aneurysm getting bigger. This will include eating healthy foods, regular exercise and not smoking. Your own doctor may also give you pills or change your medication. They may also check your blood pressure.</p>
