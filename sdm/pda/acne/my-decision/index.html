                <div data-cms-content-id="276_1_further-info_1342"><p>Acne is&nbsp;another word for spots. People with severe acne have lots of spots, or spots that are large, red, and sore.</p>
<p>Acne spots typically&nbsp;appear on the face and upper body. In these&nbsp;areas of your body&nbsp;your skin has thousands of tiny hair follicles. These hair&nbsp;follicles are&nbsp;different from the ones on your scalp because they have&nbsp;a very large gland (sebaceous gland) that produces an oily substance&nbsp;called sebum, and a very small hair. Sebum is a protective&nbsp;substance that flows through the pore onto the surface of the skin.</p>
<p>Visible acne spots start when pores become blocked. Blocked pores stop sebum flowing onto the surface of the skin and they trap acne causing bacteria. We don't know what causes pores to become blocked.</p>
<p>Spots that aren't inflamed are called <strong>whiteheads</strong>,&nbsp;when the pore is closed, and&nbsp;<strong>blackheads</strong>, when&nbsp;the pore is&nbsp;open.</p>
<p>Inflamed or red spots also start off as blocked pores (microcomedones). Spots on the surface of the skin are called <strong>papules, </strong>if they don't contain pus, or <strong>pustules</strong>, if they do contain&nbsp;pus. Deep, inflamed spots that are hard to the touch are called <strong>nodules</strong>.</p></div>

<p>The main reason teenagers get acne is probably the hormonal changes that happen during adolescence. Both boys and girls have increased levels of the hormone testosterone during puberty. The increase in testosterone can cause your skin to make more sebum, which can encourage acne.</p>
<p>Although acne usually starts to appear during adolescence, it can also start for the first time when people are older.</p>
<p>Some people get acne because of tight clothes, or exposure to chemicals at work, or greasy make-up. We don't cover these types of acne in this decision aid.</p>
<p>You are more likely to have acne if other people in your family have it too.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Williams HC, Dellavalle RP, Garner S. Acne vulgaris. Lancet. 2012; 379: 361-372.</span></p>
<p>Some things that can make acne worse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rubbing your skin</li>
<li>Picking or squeezing spots</li>
<li>Tight clothes, bicycle helmets, or bag straps that rub the skin</li>
<li>Pollution and high humidity</li>
<li>For women, the hormonal changes during menstrual periods, and when people start or stop taking the contraceptive pill</li>

<li>You have very oily skin</li>

<p>Treatments can help control acne. It can take six to nine weeks before you can tell if treatment is working. Some treatments need to be taken for six months or longer. If one treatment doesn't help you, ask if another treatment might work better.</p>
<p>Most people are treated by their GP. He or she may suggest seeing a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (a dermatologist) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your acne is severe</li>
<li>You're at risk of scarring</li>
<li>You've tried several treatments without finding one that works</li>
<li>Your acne is&nbsp;upsetting you a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things people can try to keep acne-prone skin comfortable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning skin gently. Some people try to get rid of grease and spots by scrubbing their skin, but this can make acne worse.</li>
<li>Avoiding touching spots. Squeezing or picking your spots can leave marks and make your acne worse.</li>
<li>Using oil-free make-up, moisturisers, and sun-creams. Some types of make-up can block pores and cause spots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spots themselves don't cause serious physical harm, but if they aren't treated early, they can leave scars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main harm acne causes is emotional. Many people with acne don't like the way it looks. Some people find it embarrassing, and even become upset or depressed. If you're concerned about your acne, make sure your doctor understands how you feel.</p></div>

<p><strong>Emotional problems</strong></p>
<p>Acne is often at its worst during teenage years and early adulthood. This is when people often have trouble with self-confidence and self-esteem. Some people with acne feel anxious, embarrassed, ashamed, or depressed. They may avoid socialising and going out.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Williams HC, Dellavalle RP, Garner S. Acne vulgaris. Lancet. 2012; 379: 361-372.</span></p>
<p>If your acne is having a big effect on your life, you may want to speak to your doctor. He or she can arrange for you to see a counsellor. There are also a number of acne support groups on the internet that you can join. There are currently no acne support groups in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Scarring</strong></p>
<p>Facial scarring from acne affects up to <a href="http://sdm.rightcare.nhs.uk/media_manager/public/150/images/Acne/20-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a> teenagers.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Williams HC, Dellavalle RP, Garner S. Acne vulgaris. Lancet. 2012; 379: 361-372.</span></p>
<p>It may be possible to avoid scarring by having treatment as soon as acne appears. People are more likely to have scarring if acne is left untreated for a long time. Even mild acne that is left untreated can cause scars.</p>
<p>There are two main types of acne scar:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atrophic</strong>. These are sunken scars caused by loss of tissue.</li>
<li><strong>Hypertrophic</strong>. These are raised scars caused by an increase in tissue.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of treatments to reduce acne scarring but none of them completely removes the scars. Preventing scarring by treating acne effectively is the best course of action.</p>
<p>If your acne scars are not severe, and you are young, your scars may fade with time.</p>
<p><strong>Pigment changes</strong></p>
<p>When acne clears up it can leave a change in the skin causing an increase (<strong>hyperpigmentation</strong>) or decrease (<strong>hypopigmentation</strong>) in the pigment in the skin.&nbsp;This is when the colour of your skin changes in the area where the acne used to be.&nbsp;These changes are more obvious in skin of colour. Unlike other acne scars, hyper- and hypopigmentation leave a flat scar that usually disappears within two years.</p></div>

<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>
<p>Some people believe that certain foods and drinks, such as chocolate, milk, or coffee, causes acne or makes acne worse. We don't know if this is the case. You need to ensure your diet is healthy and balanced if you decide to avoid certain foods. You may want to talk to your GP before you try this. <br /><br /><strong>Complementary therapies</strong></p>
<p>Complementary therapies to treat acne include acupuncture, Ayurvedic treatments (oral and topical), homeopathy, essential oils, and Chinese herbal remedies. Some complementary therapies are said to help reduce acne inflammation and others are believed to help kill bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmetics</strong></p>
<p>These include concealers, correctors, foundation, and other 'camouflaging' cosmetics. Cosmetics don't aim to treat acne, but rather to mask it.

<p>Many different foods, including&nbsp;sugary foods, greasy foods, and milk (particularly skimmed milk)&nbsp;have been said to cause acne. We don&rsquo;t know for certain that this is the case. We do know that some groups of people that don&rsquo;t have a Western-diet, such as the Inuit (indigenous people of the Arctic region) and Ache (native hunter-gatherers from Paraguay), don&rsquo;t have acne, but when these groups are exposed to Western diets, they are prone to acne.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">Smith RN, Mann NJ, Baue A, et al. A low-glycemic load diet improves symptoms in acne vulgaris patients: a randomized controlled trial. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2007; 86: 107-115.</span></p>
<p>Western diets are high in foods that convert quickly into energy. These so-called 'high glycaemic-index' (high GI) foods include corn flakes, white rice, white bread, biscuits, and ice cream. Your body converts low glycaemic-index foods into energy much more slowly. Low glycaemic-index (low GI) foods include beans, seeds, vegetables, and fruits.</p>
<p>In a small group of young men with mild to moderate facial acne (43 people), those put on a low GI diet (23 men) for 12 weeks had almost twice as much acne clear up as those on a high GI diet (20 men).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">Smith RN, Mann NJ, Baue A, et al. A low-glycemic load diet improves symptoms in acne vulgaris patients: a randomized controlled trial. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2007; 86: 107-115.</span> Because it was only a small group, it is not possible to say for certain that low GI diets will help improve your acne. This is one of a number of studies that suggest that diet may have an&nbsp;effect on acne.&nbsp;We need&nbsp;more proof before we can be sure of the effect of diet on acne.<br /><br /><strong>Complementary therapies</strong></p>
<p>There is a huge variety of complementary therapies to treat acne.

<p>If&nbsp;you are considering seeing a&nbsp;complementary medicine practitioner, you may want to check their&nbsp;credentials first and ensure that they are registered with a professional body.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cosmetics to mask acne</strong></p>
<p>Camouflaging your acne with concealers, correctors and foundations may give you more confidence when socialising. Cosmetics are not just for women. There are concealers marketed specifically for men.</p></div>

<p><strong>Cosmetics to mask acne</strong></p>
<p>There are no side effects from using cosmetics to mask acne. You may want to look for products labelled 'non-comedogenic', which means they&nbsp;are unlikely to&nbsp;make acne worse or cause skin irritation (irritant contact dermatitis). Thick make-up and make-up that contains oil may block the pores and cause a different type of acne known as pomade acne.</p>
<p>It is important to remember to remove cosmetics with a gentle cleanser&nbsp;at night, especially before&nbsp;applying topical therapies.</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="276_2_further-info_1357_0"><p>Treatments that are applied to the skin are called topical therapies. They come in a number of forms including creams, gels, foams, and washes. Some can be bought without a prescription at pharmacies and shops. Others need a prescription from your doctor.</p>
<p>There are many treatments used on the skin for acne. These are some of the better known ones:</p>
<p><strong>Retinoids</strong>&nbsp;work by stopping dead skin cells from clogging pores. They can also help reduce inflammation (redness and swelling). Topical retinoids are usually used alongside other topical therapies, such as benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics. Because they unplug pores, they allow other therapies to enter the pores and work more effectively. Topical retinoids are usually used for moderate to severe acne. They are usually applied to the skin once a day, at night time, about half an hour after the skin has been washed. They can only be bought with a prescription. Topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, and tretinoin.</p>
<p><strong>Benzoyl peroxide</strong>&nbsp;helps to kill bacteria and unblock pores. You use the cream or gel once or twice a day, usually after you wash. Benzoyl peroxide can be bought without a prescription. It is sometimes used alongside antibiotics to prevent bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong>&nbsp;are medicines that kill bacteria. Using an antibiotic gel or cream helps to get rid of the bacteria that make your spots red and inflamed.&nbsp;Topical antibiotics only treat inflammatory acne. They do not treat blackheads or whiteheads. You'll need to use your treatment once or twice a day for two months. You will need a prescription for topical antibiotics. Topical antibiotics include clindamycin and erythromycin.</p>
<p><strong>Azelaic acid</strong>&nbsp;stops bacteria multiplying on the surface of the skin. It also helps to keep skin pores clear. If benzoyl peroxide irritates your skin too much, you may wish to try azelaic acid as it tends to cause less irritation. Azelaic acid is applied to the skin once or twice a day. It can only be bought with a prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotinamide</strong>&nbsp;reduces the inflammation (redness and swelling) in inflammatory acne. It is used to treat mild to moderate acne. Nicotinamide needs to be applied to the skin twice a day. Gels containing nicotinamide can be bought without a prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Salicylic acid</strong>&nbsp;works by stopping dead skin cells from clogging pores. It is used to treat blackheads and whiteheads. If retinoids irritate your skin too much, you may wish to try salicylic acid as it tends to cause less irritation. Gels and washes containing salicylic acid can be bought without a prescription.</p>
<p>Some of these treatments contain more than one of the above substances. Gels that contain retinoids or benzoyl peroxide also often contain an antibiotic. These combination topical therapies usually work better than a single topical therapy alone.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Strauss JS, Krowchuk DP, Leyden JJ.

<p>There are too many&nbsp;topical therapies to list all of the side effects here. You can ask your&nbsp;pharmacist about the potential side effects of individual treatments, or read the label.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any mild side effects (such as skin irritation), you may want to reduce the amount of the treatment you use and apply it less often. These treatments are made up in different substances to make them easy to apply to the skin. Some, such as alcohol, are harsher on the skin than others. If you are using an alcohol-solution treatment that is irritating your skin, you could try it in a different form, maybe in a moisturising cream. If the irritation doesn&rsquo;t go away after a few weeks, even when you use less or use it less often, you might want to consider a different treatment.</p>

<p>It can take&nbsp;six to eight weeks before you see the benefits of these treatments. Many people give up before the treatment has had a chance to work. If you start on a treatment, it is important to continue with it for at least four weeks to give it a chance to show an effect.</p></div>

<p>There are three main types of&nbsp;oral medicine for treating acne:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oral antibiotics</strong>&nbsp;reduce the number of bacteria on the skin. They are usually used alongside a topical treatment, such as benzoyl peroxide, to kill bacteria that survive the antibiotics.&nbsp;There are three main types ("classes") of oral antibiotic used to treat acne: tetracyclines such as tetracycline,&nbsp;doxycycline,&nbsp;lymecycline, and minocycline; macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin; and trimethoprim.</li>
<li><strong>Hormone therapies</strong>, especially combined oral contraceptive pills that contain the 'female' hormones oestrogen and progestin, work by reducing the effect of 'male' hormones (androgens). Androgens (such as testosterone) increase the activity of the glands that produce sebum. Hormone therapies can be used&nbsp;by some&nbsp;girls who have started their periods or some women.</li>
<li><strong>Isotretinoin</strong> is an oral retinoid (a substance related to vitamin A) that has many effects on acne, including&nbsp;reducing the amount of&nbsp;sebum the skin produces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another treatment sometimes prescribed&nbsp;to treat&nbsp;acne&nbsp;is spironolactone, which works by blocking the effects of hormones called androgens.</p>
<p>Oral medicines are only available with a doctor's prescription. Isotretinoin is used for severe acne that has not cleared with other treatments. It can only be prescribed by a specialist skin&nbsp;doctor (a dermatologist).</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="276_2_further-info_1358_1"><p>Oral medicines are usually used to treat moderate to severe acne. People are more likely to have oral medicines if they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe acne</li>
<li>Acne that is&nbsp;on the torso (chest, back, shoulders)</li>
<li>Acne that hasn't responded to topical treatments, or oral antibiotics, or both</li>
<li>Acne that is likely to form scars</li>
<li>Acne that is causing emotional upset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oral antibiotics</strong></p>
<p>People with kidney or liver disease may not be able to take certain oral antibiotics.&nbsp;Also, doctors are not&nbsp;keen to prescribe some antibiotics (especially macrolides and trimethoprim) because they are becoming less effective.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Williams HC, Dellavalle RP, Garner S. Acne vulgaris. Lancet. 2012; 379: 361-372.</span></p>
<p>Children under 12 years of age&nbsp;are advised against taking&nbsp;tetracycline antibiotics&nbsp;because it can&nbsp;permanently discolour&nbsp;tooth enamel and affect their bone development.</p>
<p>If oral antibiotics are used for more than two months, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide (a topical therapy)&nbsp;is used alongside antibiotics or for at least five to seven days between antibiotic courses to reduce surviving bacteria on the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Hormone therapies</strong></p>
<p>Hormone therapies&nbsp;can be used by&nbsp;girls who have started their periods or some women. The combined oral contraceptive pill can be suitable for women who have acne flare-ups before their period starts, and who need contraception.</p>
<p>People with one or more of the following 'risk factors' (things that&nbsp;can make taking the drug dangerous) may&nbsp;be advised against taking&nbsp;the&nbsp;combined oral contraceptive pill:</p>
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>A&nbsp;personal or family history of developing blood clots (thrombosis)</li>
<li>Heart problems, including an irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Age over 40</li>
<li>Smoker.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Isotretinoin</strong></p>
<p>Isotretinoin is prescribed for people with moderate or severe acne. It can have serious side effects and is only recommended when all other therapies (including oral antibiotics) have failed. People need&nbsp;to be referred to a&nbsp;skin specialist (dermatologist) before they are prescribed isotretinoin. Isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a dermatologist.</p>
<p>Isotretinoin must not be taken by pregnant or breastfeeding women, women who are trying to conceive, girls under 12 years old, or people taking tetracycline antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>Buying prescription&nbsp;medicine on the internet</strong></p>
<p>Some people may be tempted to bypass their GP or dermatologist and buy medicines over the internet without a prescription. This is a very dangerous thing to do. Most medicines bought on the internet are fake (counterfeit). Some contain the drug they claim to be selling, but in the wrong amount (which can have cause side effects) or they contain&nbsp;none of the drug they claim to be selling, only harmful substances.</p></div>

<p>Bacteria called <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em> live naturally in hair follicles where they&nbsp;live on sebum. They don't cause any trouble, unless they become trapped in&nbsp;hair follicles.&nbsp;When this happens, the area around the hair follicles becomes inflamed (red and swollen) as the body's immune system tries to fight the bacteria. Oral antibiotics reduce these bacteria.

<p>Most of the side effects of isotretinoin are temporary and clear up when you stop taking the medication.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Strauss JS, Krowchuk DP, Leyden JJ.

<p>You will need to take&nbsp;antibiotic pills once or twice a day (depending on the antibiotic),&nbsp;every day, for&nbsp;at least six months.</p>
<p>Some people become sensitive to sunlight when taking tetracylines. If you spend a lot of time outdoors you should wear sunscreen. You will also need to avoid using sunbeds.</p>
<p><strong>Hormone therapies</strong></p>
<p>The way you take hormone treatment varies between different types. For some common types, you have to remember to take a pill every day for three weeks, followed by a week off, for as long as you need treatment. Other types are taken continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Isotretinoin</strong></p>
<p>Isotretinoin needs to be taken once or twice a day, every day, for&nbsp;at least six months.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-18">18</span>]<span id="reference-18" class="content-reference">Nast A, Dr&eacute;no B, Bettoli V, et al.

<p>If you are a woman and you are prescribed isotretinoin, you will need to sign a form saying that you understand the risk of birth defects and you are willing to use contraceptives to avoid becoming pregnant, even if you are not currently sexually active. Contraceptives need to be used at least one month before treatment, throughout treatment, and at least one month after stopping treatment. You may be advised to use more than one form of contraception.</p>
<p>Some people become sensitive to sunlight when taking isotretinoin. If you spend a lot of time outdoors you should wear sunscreen. You will also need to avoid using sunbeds.</p>
<p>You will need to avoid having hair waxed, laser treatment, and any other treatment that is rough to your skin while taking isotretinoin, and for six months after stopping treatment. These procedures could cause scarring.</p>
<p>Isotretinoin can cause dry eyes. If you wear contact lenses, you may need to switch to glasses if your eyes become dry.</p>
<p>Isotretinoin may also affect your night vision. If this is the case, it may make driving at night difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>You must not donate blood while on isotretinoin.</p>
<p>Before you take any vitamins, supplements, or&nbsp;medicine that can be bought&nbsp;without a prescription, you need to check with your doctor to ensure they are safe to take. Some medicines and supplements (such as vitamin A), react with isotretinoin and can make side effects worse.</p></div>
