<p>If you decide to have&nbsp;a vaginal birth after a caesarean section, there is a chance that the area of the uterus which was opened to deliver&nbsp;your baby last time (the uterine scar) may&nbsp;separate or tear during labour.&nbsp;This happens to about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Birth-options-after-previous-caesarean/2-1000.jpg" class="image-reference">2 in 1,000</a> women having a vaginal birth.<span class="content-reference">Fitzpatrick KE, Kurinczuk JJ, Alfirevic Z, et al. Uterine rupture by intended mode of delivery in the UK: a national case-control study. PLoS Medicine. 2012; 9: e1001184.</span> Although this is considered to be an emergency situation, hospitals nowadays are well equipped to deal with uterine tears if they happen.</p>
<p>Before,&nbsp;women who'd had a previous caesarean section&nbsp;were often advised to have another caesarean section. However, we now know that a separation or tear is rare. Nowadays, a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean section&nbsp;is thought to be as safe as another caesarean section, in most cases. Mothers and babies are monitored during the birth, so early signs of a separation or tear can be picked up.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="116_1_further-info_775"><p>This is what may happen if you choose either a vaginal birth or a caesarean section.</p>
<p><strong>Vaginal birth</strong></p>
<p>If you plan for a vaginal birth, you will be advised to have your baby in a hospital where there are obstetricians (specialists in complicated childbirth), midwives, and anaesthetists (specialists in pain management and anaesthesia) who can monitor and support you and your baby during delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will go into the hospital when you are in labour. You will be offered close monitoring of your baby to check that his or her heartbeat is normal. You can have the usual types of pain relief, including an epidural.</p>
<p>If your labour does not progress or runs into difficulties, or your baby becomes distressed, you may need to have a&nbsp;caesarean section.</p>
<p><strong>Caesarean section</strong></p>
<p>If you plan to have a caesarean section, you will go to the hospital at an agreed date, usually within seven days of your due date. Your baby will be delivered in an operating theatre, through a cut made in your abdomen, usually through the scar from your previous caesarean section. Most planned caesarean sections are done under an anaesthetic that numbs the lower part of the body. This is called&nbsp;a regional anaesthetic. You will usually be awake.</p>
<p>If your labour starts before the date planned for your caesarean section, and is already advanced by the time you arrive at the hospital, the maternity care team may suggest that you continue in labour and have a vaginal birth instead of the planned caesarean section. This happens to about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Birth-options-after-previous-caesarean/2-100.jpg" class="image-reference">2 in 100</a> women.<span class="content-reference">Crowther CA, Dodd JM, Hiller JE, et al. Planned vaginal birth or elective repeat caesarean: patient preference restricted cohort with nested randomised trial. PLoS Medicine. 2012; 9: e1001192.</span></p>
<p>Some women who plan to have a caesarean section may need to have an&nbsp;unplanned caesarean section because labour has started earlier than expected. This happens to about&nbsp;<a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Birth-options-after-previous-caesarean/10-100.jpg" class="image-reference">10 in 100</a>&nbsp;women.<span class="content-reference">Crowther CA, Dodd JM, Hiller JE, et al. Planned vaginal birth or elective repeat caesarean: patient preference restricted cohort with nested randomised trial. PLoS Medicine. 2012; 9: e1001192.</span>&nbsp;An&nbsp;unplanned caesarean section&nbsp;means that the caesarean section&nbsp;is done before the planned caesarean section&nbsp;date. This doesn't necessarily mean there is any danger to the mother or her baby.</p></div>

<p>Here, we have divided the things that can go wrong into major problems (things that threaten the life of the mother or baby) and other problems (those that may affect the health of the mother or baby). These problems are treatable. They can happen if you have a vaginal birth or a planned caesarean section.&nbsp; We give more information about the chances of these things happening in the compare options table in Step 2.</p>
<p><strong>Major problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Uterine tear (rupture), where the uterus tears. The tear is usually along the line of the scar from the previous caesarean section.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Severe bleeding which cannot be controlled. This may happen as a result of uterine rupture. As a last resort, women having severe bleeding may need to have the uterus removed (a hysterectomy).</li>
<li>Direct injury to the baby, caused by the birth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other problems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Endometritis (an infection in the womb occurring after delivery), which can be effectively treated with antibiotics.</li>

Some women might be advised not to plan for a vaginal birth. This could be for a number of reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason why they needed a caesarean section&nbsp;in their last pregnancy. For example, a woman may have a health condition, such as heart disease, that could be made worse by the stress of labour.</li>
<li>The type of caesarean section&nbsp;operation they had. Some types of surgery may leave women with a higher chance of a uterine tear in their next pregnancy.</li>
<li>A woman's age. There is a greater chance of women having problems during labour if they are over the age of 40.</li>
<li>A woman's weight. Women who are very overweight are less likely to have a successful vaginal birth than women who are not overweight.</li>
<li>The way the baby is lying in the uterus, or the way the baby is growing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the medical factors, you will have your own feelings and preferences for the type of birth you want. You may also want to consider practical issues like being able to drive or look after other children soon after the birth, or think ahead to your plans for more children in future. The information in the following sections may help you think this through.</p>
<p>You will probably want to talk to your partner and family about your choice. For information and advice, you can speak to your obstetrician and midwife, preferably by the 36th week of your pregnancy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

You should be able to go home from hospital sooner and get on with your life. If you need stitches because of tearing, your recovery from vaginal birth may take longer than if you don't need stitches.</p>
<p>You should be able to get back to your normal activities, including looking after other children, driving, and normal social activities, as soon as you feel well enough to do so. Having a vaginal birth may make it easier for you to hold and breastfeed your baby immediately after birth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)</strong>: TENS delivers mild electric pulses through electrodes that are placed on the lower back. It is thought that the electric pulses stimulate the body to produce its own natural painkillers, called endorphins. Doctors have found no proof that TENS works effectively to relieve pain during childbirth.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">Dowswell T, Bedwell C, Lavender T, et al. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief in labour (Cochrane review). In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span></li>
<li><strong>Gas and air (Entonox)</strong>: Gas and air is a half-and-half mixture of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and oxygen. You inhale it through a mouthpiece or mask. The pain-killing effect lasts for the&nbsp;duration of a contraction but then&nbsp;quickly wears off. Gas and air makes some women feel nauseous.</li>
<li><strong>Opiates&nbsp;(diamorphine,&nbsp;pethidine)</strong>: These medicines don't completely block pain, but they do reduce pain and help you relax. They are delivered through a drip directly into a vein, or injected into a large muscle, such as the thigh or bottom. They take about 30 minutes to work and the painkilling effect lasts for about two hours. These medicines can make you feel nauseous. The effects of the medicine are also passed on to the baby. They can slow down your baby's breathing and he or she may need medicine to cancel the effects of the painkiller. They may also affect your baby's sucking reflex, making breastfeeding difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Regional anaesthesia (epidural)</strong>: A regional anaesthetic numbs part (a "region")&nbsp;of your body. The painkiller is&nbsp;carefully injected into your lower back in part of the spine called "the epidural space". Unlike other types of pain relief,&nbsp;an epidural usually completely removes pain. An epidural can slow labour down, but it doesn't seem to affect the success of vaginal birth after caesarean section.</li>

With a ventouse delivery, <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Birth-options-after-previous-caesarean/4-100.jpg" class="image-reference">4 in 100</a> women will have tearing of the muscle.

<p>A ventouse delivery is safe for your baby, but it can leave a mark (called a chignon) on his or her head. This usually disappears within a day or two. Forceps can also leave bruising or minor cuts on your baby's head, but these also heal within a day or two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can take around a month to recover from a caesarean section and get back to your normal activities, including looking after other children, normal social activities, and driving. Some women recover faster and some need more time. Having a caesarean section&nbsp;can make it more difficult to breastfeed your baby at first.</p>
<p>If you have more than&nbsp;two caesarean sections, the&nbsp;chance of having problems during a future pregnancy&nbsp;may be increased. Your placenta may grow into the wall of the womb&nbsp;after&nbsp;having several caesarean sections. This is called placenta&nbsp;accreta. It can cause problems with the placenta separating properly during delivery, which can lead to more than usual bleeding.</p>
<p>The chance of&nbsp;placenta accreta is higher with each repeat&nbsp;caesarean section:</p>

<p>A hysterectomy may be needed to stop the bleeding if you have placenta accreta. This is usually a last resort. You may want to think about this if you plan to have more children in future.</p>

For some women, an epidural may be more effective. Spinal blocks and epidurals are called regional anaesthetics because they numb a region of your body while allowing you to remain awake to hear your baby when he or she is born. You won't feel any pain but you will feel some pressure or movement as your baby is delivered.</p>
<p>For an&nbsp;unplanned caesarean section, you will usually&nbsp;have a spinal&nbsp;anaesthetic. If&nbsp;an epidural has been used for pain relief then this may be effective for the caesarean section when topped up with stronger medication. A small number of women may need a general&nbsp;anaesthetic to deliver their baby. General anaesthesia is not usually used for a planned caesarean section.</p></div>

If a woman had to have stitches, it may be a couple of weeks before she feels comfortable enough to drive.</p>                                    <a href="#option-671-further-info" class="popup stick-to-bottom std-link" title="View further information about Planned Vaginal Birth in a pop up window">more information</a>

                <p>Women can hold and breastfeed their baby immediately after a planned caesarean section. <br /><br />Women are not able to drive for a few weeks after a caesarean section.&nbsp;Some women may need longer before they feel comfortable enough to drive. Insurance companies sometimes require that a woman wait a specific number of weeks before driving or that her doctor certifies that she is fit to drive.<br /><br />While the wound is healing, women should not do strenuous exercise or household chores, lift anything heavier than their baby, or have sex. They can start doing these things once they feel able to do them and they do not cause pain. For some women, this may be in a few weeks. For others, it may be longer.</p>                                    <a href="#option-672-further-info" class="popup stick-to-bottom std-link" title="View further information about Planned Caesarean Section in a pop up window">more information</a>

<p class="TableContents">Having multiple caesarean sections may increase the chance that a woman will have problems in future with her placenta not separating properly during delivery. (The placenta is the organ that provides a baby with oxygen and food while in the womb.) This is called placenta accreta and can cause more than normal bleeding during birth. A hysterectomy may be needed if the bleeding doesn't stop. This is a last resort.</p>                                    <a href="#option-672-further-info" class="popup stick-to-bottom std-link" title="View further information about Planned Caesarean Section in a pop up window">more information</a>
