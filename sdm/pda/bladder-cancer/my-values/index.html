<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

                <div data-cms-content-id="109_1_further-info_564"><p>Cancer is abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the body. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is when these abnormal cells are found within the inner layers of the bladder, but not in the main muscle coat. It is a common type of bladder cancer.</p>
<p>Specialist doctors (urologists) and&nbsp;nurses are able to provide&nbsp;exact details about the different forms of&nbsp;bladder cancer.</p>
<p>Urologists&nbsp;may talk&nbsp;about the 'stage' of bladder&nbsp;cancer (Ta, T1, Tis), which is a way of describing the&nbsp;cancer based on where it is in the bladder, and if it has spread.</p>
<p>They may also&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about the 'grade' of bladder&nbsp;cancer, which is what the cancer cells look like under the microscope. Cancers that are called low grade (Grade 1) look like normal cells and tend to grow slowly and are unlikely to spread. Cancers that are called intermediate grade (Grade 2) look somewhat abnormal, and some grow slowly with little chance of spreading, and others grow more quickly with a higher chance of spreading.&nbsp;Cancers that are called high grade (Grade 3) look abnormal and grow more quickly and are likely to spread.</p>
<p>High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer involves the following forms of bladder cancer, either singly or in combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>pTaG3 (cancer only in the surface lining of the bladder)</li>
<li>pT1G2 (cancer involving the tissue layer between the surface lining and the main muscle coat of the bladder)</li>
<li>pT1G3 (cancer involving the tissue layer between the surface lining and the main muscle coat of the bladder)</li>
<li>pTis (called carcinoma in situ, meaning cancer spreading in flat patches within the surface lining of the bladder)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is called high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a risk that there is already cancer in the muscle wall of the bladder which has not been spotted yet (this is called understaging). This may be the case for&nbsp;between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Bladder-Cancer/20-in-100-and-30-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100 to 30 in 100</a> people.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Kulkarni GS, Hakenberg OW, Gschwend JE, et al.

<li>There is a risk of the cancer returning in a more advanced form (this is called progression). This means cancer spreading into, or beyond, the main muscle coat of the bladder. This can happen to between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Bladder-Cancer/15-in-100-and-70-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">15 in 100 and more than&nbsp;70 in 100</a> people, depending on the exact type of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Burger M, Witjes JA.

</ul>
<p>When bladder cancer involves the muscle coat of the bladder, between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Bladder-Cancer/20-in-100-and-25-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100 and 25 in 100</a> people will have their&nbsp;cancer spread&nbsp;into the lymph glands around the bladder.

A urine test can be carried out by your doctor, which will tell you if there is any blood in your urine even if it's a small amount which is not visible.</p>
<p>Other symptoms of bladder cancer include feeling pain when passing urine, feeling that you need to pass urine more than usual, and feeling that you need to pass urine very suddenly, although these symptoms are more commonly due to conditions other than cancer.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="109_1_further-info_612"><p>Most people who have bladder cancer&nbsp;started by seeing their GP about their symptoms. The GP will ask about the symptoms and may ask for a urine test.</p>
<p>The GP will then make a decision on who needs to go to hospital to be seen by a specialist (a urologist), who may carry out more checks, such as blood tests and a scan.</p>
<p>The urologist may want to look inside the bladder. The procedure to do this is called a cystoscopy and it lasts for three to four minutes. This first cystoscopy is usually done using a local anaesthetic which numbs the area so it is not painful. A first cystoscopy&nbsp;involves passing a thin tube with a small telescopic camera into the opening of the urethra through to the bladder to see if there is anything abnormal in the bladder. Some people will need a second cystoscopy under general anaesthetic (where you are put to sleep) so that a small sample of the bladder tissue, called a biopsy, can be taken and examined under a microscope.</p>
<p>If the tests show that you have bladder cancer, you may be asked to go back to hospital for more scans to see how far the cancer extends, and to discuss how best to treat it.</p></div>

This operation is called a transurethral resection of bladder tumour (or TURBT). After the operation your urologist will know more about your cancer.</p>
<p>There are several treatment options that your urologist will discuss with you after your operation, depending on what form of bladder cancer you have.</p>
<p>If you have high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the treatment options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Putting the Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine into the bladder</strong></li>
<li><strong>Surgery to remove the bladder completely (this is called a cystectomy)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Watchful waiting</strong>, where your urologist will keep monitoring you, with telescopic bladder checks (cystoscopy), to check whether the cancer has come back in the bladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of these three options, BCG and surgery to remove the bladder, reduce the risk of the cancer getting worse, but watchful waiting does not. Watchful waiting will simply identify whether the cancer has come back in the bladder, and what type it is.</p>
<p>The risk of your cancer getting worse with watchful waiting is high (between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Bladder-Cancer/15-in-100-and-70-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">15 in 100 and more than 70 in 100</a>).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Burger M, Witjes JA.

<p>If your general health is reasonable or good, you are likely to be advised to have an active treatment (BCG or surgery). If your general health is poor, and other medical conditions present a higher risk to your life than your bladder cancer, you might feel that watchful waiting is an option for&nbsp;you to consider, because you avoid the problems and side effects of treating your bladder cancer.</p>
<p>Your urologist will discuss how these treatments might affect your daily life, as well as the chances of the cancer returning or spreading. Whichever option you choose, you should discuss it carefully with your urologist, your specialist nurse, and those close to you. Your urologist should be someone who specialises in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</p></div>

For women who have been through the menopause, the womb and ovaries will be removed if they have not already been removed at a previous operation (hysterectomy).

The bladder is removed through a cut (incision) in the abdomen. The cut usually runs from just above the belly button to the pubic bone. In some hospitals, the bladder can be removed by keyhole surgery (laparoscopic or robotic surgery), where the operation is done with telescopic surgery via a few small cuts in the abdomen instead of one large cut.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-4">4</span>]<span id="reference-4" class="content-reference">Efstathiou J, Quinn DI, Stenzl A.

<p>After your bladder is removed, you will need another way to drain urine from your body. There are several different options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urinary stoma</strong>: this is when urine is collected in a bag that sticks to the skin of your abdomen. Urine from your kidneys goes to a short piece of bowel (intestine) that passes out of the abdomen through a small opening (called a stoma) and allows urine to drain continually into a bag.</li>
<li><strong>Bladder substitute (or 'new bladder', sometimes called a neobladder)</strong>: a large length of bowel is used to make a replacement for your bladder, by forming a pouch (reservoir). The tubes that usually pass urine from the kidneys to the bladder (ureters) are attached directly to this pouch. With careful instruction and a good deal of effort, most people can learn to hold and pass urine in a more or less normal way.</li>
<li><strong>Cutaneous catheterisable reservoir (a urine pouch sometimes described as a Mitrofanoff procedure)</strong>: a urine pouch (reservoir) is made inside your abdomen from part of your intestine. The ureters are attached directly to the pouch. The pouch is connected to the surface using a channel made from bowel and attached to the skin of the abdominal wall, often at the navel. There is a valve mechanism that prevents continual leakage of urine. The pouch is emptied by passing a catheter into the pouch via the navel.</li>

Most hospitals should have lower death rates than that. You can ask your specialist what the rates of complications are in your hospital.</p>

<li>A blood clot (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus)</li>
<li>An abnormal heart rhythm</li>

<li>Blockage or leakage from the surgical joins where the bowel is rejoined, or where the tubes from the kidneys (ureters) are joined to the bowel that makes the urinary drainage mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>These complications might result in a longer hospital stay than planned.</p>
<p>Cystectomy is likely to affect your sex life.&nbsp;The nerves that control erections may be damaged during surgery. This means that almost all men who have cystecomy will either not get any erections after their surgery, or will not get erections firm enough for sex. Men almost always have their prostate gland taken out during the operation. This will mean that they cannot ejaculate after surgery.</p>
<p>In women, surgery to remove the bladder can make the vagina shorter and narrower. This may make having sex painful or difficult. The womb and ovaries may also be taken out during surgery. This will mean they will not be able to have children.</p>
<p>For some patients, surgery can be done in a way that attempts to preserve nerves involved with sensation during sex. If this sort of surgery is possible and safe for your particular cancer, this may reduce the impact of surgery on your sex life.</p></div>

You will have a scar on your abdomen where the surgeon made the cut. You will need to see your urologist regularly for check-ups after surgery. This is to check the cancer has not come back, and to check that urinary drainage is working well.</p>
<p>You will have either a urinary stoma (a bag on your abdomen into which urine drains) or an internal pouch made from bowel, which replaces the bladder, depending on the type of surgery you have. The internal pouch is either connected to the urethra, so that you hold and pass urine more or less normally (bladder substitute) or connected to the abdominal wall, so that you empty the pouch by passing a plastic tube (catheter) into it several times each day (catheterisable reservoir).</p>
<p>Whichever of these forms of surgery is done, you will need to get used to the way that they work. The one that most people find simplest and easiest to use is a stoma (external bag). Either of the internal pouches (bladder substitute or catheterisable reservoir) requires more time and effort to get used to how they work and to learn to use them effectively. In the first few months after surgery, people with an internal pouch need more frequent follow-up visits to hospital.</p>
<p>Some people find it hard to come to terms with the stoma, or to manage it. This could affect your relationships with your partner, family, friends, or work colleagues. It may also affect how you feel when meeting new people. Managing a stoma affects people in different ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes don't bother some people. Some people may become anxious, less confident, or depressed. Other people may not be worried by the changes.</p>
<p>Some people are bothered by having to get used to managing their urinary flow with a pouch, or by having a stoma. The research does not show that people's quality of life is better with one type of urinary drainage compared to another.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-27">27</span>]<span id="reference-27" class="content-reference">Gerharz EW, Mansson A, Hunt S, et al.

<p>Unless you do heavy physical work, your surgery should not make any difference to your job once you have recovered from surgery. You should also be able to do exercise, such as swimming, running, horse riding, or golf, even if you have a stoma (external bag).</p>
<p>Many people find problems with their sex lives distressing. This can affect your relationship and your confidence.</p></div>
