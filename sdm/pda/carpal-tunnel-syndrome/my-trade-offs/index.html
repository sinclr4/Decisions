<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

<li>Tingling, pins and needles, or numbness in the hand</li>
<li>A weak or clumsy hand</li>
<li>Dry skin, swelling, or colour changes in the fingers and hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>People who have symptoms that are severe and come on very suddenly (this is called acute severe pain) should see a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The symptoms may come and go, but they will probably get worse over time. More than <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Carpel-tunnel/33-100.jpg" class="image-reference">33 in 100</a> people with carpal tunnel syndrome recover completely within six months without treatment, although symptoms could return&nbsp;later.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Futami T, Kobayashi A, Utika T, et al. Carpal tunnel syndrome; its natural history. Hand Surgery. 1997; 2: 129-130.</span></p>
<p>Some people with carpal tunnel syndrome might drop things as their grip becomes weaker. Some people can't use their hands to feel whether things are hot or cold. If the nerve damage becomes severe, they may lose the feeling in their hand. They might not be able to use that hand much anymore.</p>
<p>People with carpal tunnel syndrome&nbsp;may find that their symptoms are worse after certain activities, such as painting, knitting, or driving. They might find that repetitive movements of the hand and wrist, or holding the arm or hand in one position, bring on the symptoms.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. Practice parameter for carpal tunnel syndrome (summary statement). Neurology. 1993; 43: 2406-2409.</span> They may wake up at night because their hand tingles or their wrist aches. Shaking the hand or changing its position often makes it feel better.</p>
<p>People who have symptoms that are very bad for three to four weeks at a time should speak to a doctor as soon as possible. Early treatment can help.</p>
<p>If carpal tunnel syndrome affects both of the hands, the dominant hand (the right one for someone who is right-handed) is usually affected first and more severely.</p></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Changes to lifestyle and activities</strong>: if someone with carpal tunnel syndrome has a hobby or activity that causes them pain, they could try doing it less often, or stopping it altogether for a while. They could try changing the hand's position from time to time when doing things that cause them pain.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to the work environment</strong>: this means adjusting desks, chairs, and computer monitors, and using specially designed keyboards (sometimes called ergonomic keyboards) or equipment to achieve the best posture for the hand and the forearm. There are different types of computer mouse designed for people with hand pain, such as a trackball or joystick mouse. People may choose to do their own research (perhaps on the internet) on things like good posture, stretching exercises, and the best equipment to use.</li>
<li><strong>Using aids</strong>: such as special scissors and shears.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be possible for someone with carpal tunnel syndrome to see an occupational therapist where they work, who can provide advice on how to change activities that cause them difficulty.</p></div>

<p>Paracetamol is unlikely to cause side effects at the correct dose. Taking too much paracetamol can cause liver damage.</p>
<p>NSAIDs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can cause bleeding in the stomach when taken over a long period. They may also damage the kidneys. NSAIDs may raise the risk of heart attacks and stroke. NSAIDs may not be suitable for some people with certain conditions, such as asthma, a peptic ulcer, or angina, or in people who have had a heart attack or stroke.</p></div>

<p>Keyhole surgery may cause temporary nerve problems such as numbness and tingling. Open surgery may lead to wound infection or haematoma.</p>
<p>With both types of surgery, it's possible that the pain from the scar or the stiffness in the wrist may be worse than the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The wrist may also lose strength because the carpal ligament is cut. These side effects are rare.</p></div>
