<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>

<ul>
<li>Your lens might get clumps in it. Your lens is made up mostly of water and protein. As you get older, the protein can clump up and cloud your lens. Then less light is focused on the back of your eye. Your vision might get blurry.</li>
<li>Your lens might change colour. When you are younger, your lens doesn't have any colour. As you get older, it slowly turns yellow-brown. You might find it harder to see some colours, such as blues and purples. This yellowing of the lens might blur your vision by making your eye more short sighted. You may be able to correct this blurriness with a new glasses prescription.</li>

<p><strong>Radiation. </strong>Rarely, people get cataracts if they come into contact with certain types of radiation, such as the kind of radiation that comes from radiotherapy. Being near intense heat may also increase your chances of getting cataracts.</p>
<p><strong>Having surgery for other eye problems.</strong> Some people get cataracts after surgery for a different eye problem called glaucoma.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Having diabetes.</strong> People who have diabetes often get cataracts, and at a younger age than people who don't have diabetes.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Klein BE, Klein R, Lee KE, et al.

American Journal of Ophthalmology. 1998; 126: 782-790.</span></p>
<p><strong>Taking steroids.</strong> Getting cataracts has been linked to taking drugs called steroids for a long time. This includes steroids used as creams, as drops to treat eye problems, and steroids that you breathe in to treat asthma.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Jobling AI, Augusteyn RC. What causes steroid cataracts? A review of steroid-induced posterior subcapsular cataracts. Clinical and Experimental Optometry. 2002; 85: 2.</span></p>
<p><strong>Smoking. </strong>People who smoke heavily are more likely to get cataracts in middle age than other people.<span class="content-reference">[Flaye DE, Sullivan KN, Cullinan TR, et al. Cataracts and cigarette smoking: the City Eye Study. Eye. 1989; 3: 379-384.]&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>An eye test (also called a visual acuity test). You are asked to read letters from different rows of a chart. This measures how well you see at certain distances.</li>
<li>An examination to look inside your eye. In this test, drops are put in your eye to make your pupil wider so that the doctor can see more of the inside of your eye. Your ophthalmologist will look inside your eye to see if you have a cataract.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your cataract has been there for some time, the centre of your eye (your pupil) will be grey or white. By this stage your eyesight will be severely affected. Some people will need more tests or a more detailed examination.</p>
<p>Your doctor will ask you how much your cataract bothers you. The doctor will also try to find out how much your vision affects what you can do in your daily life. They will ask if you are able to do things like read a newspaper, see traffic signs or watch television.</p>
<p>They will also ask about your health and any other eye problems you have had or have. You might have other tests to find out more about the health of your eyes.</p></div>

<p>Your ophthalmologist, optician or GP can refer you to your local low vision service. The low vision service can give you advice about adapting to changes in your vision and information about visual aids that make everyday tasks easier. They can also tell you about support that is available for people with poor vision.</p>
<p>Visual aids can help you adjust to a loss of vision and make the most of the vision you have. They will not restore your vision or prevent any further loss of vision.</p></div>

<p>We know that people waiting to have a cataracts operation tend to see their ability to do things get worse over time. One group of women aged over 70 waiting to have a cataracts operation filled in a questionnaire that measured what they could do in daily life. The questionnaire asked if they were able to do things like read a newspaper, see traffic signs, or watch television. On a scale of 1 to 100, people's scores got worse during the six months they waited, from 80 in 100 to 74 in 100.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-14">14</span>]<span id="reference-14" class="content-reference">Harwood RH, Foss AJ, Osborn F, et al.

<p>Some people with a cataract are still legally able to drive. If you have cataracts in just one eye you will not need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about your medical condition provided you have no other medical condition in the other eye. If you have cataracts in both eyes you will need to tell the DVLA about your medical condition.</p>

<p>Cataracts can make it difficult to drive at night or in bright sunlight because of the glare. You can try visual aids such as eyeshades to help with this, if your eyesight (with glasses) is good enough for you to legally drive. If your eyesight is not good enough to drive, using visual aids won't help. People who have cataracts are more likely to have accidents or say they have problems driving than people who have had cataracts removed.</p></div>

<p>We've included some information about what happens before and during the operation. You can ask your doctors for more information about how to prepare for surgery and what you need to do afterwards.</p>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Before The Operation</p>
<p>You usually have an appointment with the eye surgeon a week or two before your operation. This is to measure your eye, to prepare for the best artificial lens to replace your natural lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day of the operation a nurse will help you get ready for surgery.&nbsp;You will be given anaesthetic eye drops or gel to numb your eye to stop you feeling any pain. You won&rsquo;t be able to feel the eye that is being operated on, but you&rsquo;ll be awake. It may be possible for you to have other types of anaesthetic if you are feeling very anxious.</p>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">During The Operation</p>
<p>You will probably see the light of the microscope your eye surgeon uses. You may also see flashes of light, or you may catch a glimpse of the surgical instruments.</p>
<p>Most people don't find this uncomfortable. Around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Cateracts/2-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">2 in 100</a>&nbsp;people find the light from the microscope uncomfortably bright. A nurse will explain how to signal if you feel uncomfortable.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-19">19</span>]<span id="reference-19" class="content-reference">Newman DK. Visual experience during phacoemulsification cataract surgery under topical anaesthesia. British Journal of Ophthalmology. 2000; 84: 13-15.</span></p>
<p>There are two ways to remove the lens which has the cataract. In both, your eye surgeon will make a cut in the clear layer (cornea) that covers the front of your eye and then remove your cloudy lens through the cut.</p>
<p>The usual way of doing the operation is called phacoemulsification (or 'phaco' for short).&nbsp;The surgeon makes a small cut, usually about 3 millimetres long, in the cornea. He or she puts a tool with a fine needle through the cut to reach the lens. The tool gives off high-energy ultrasound waves. These sound waves break down the lens into small soft pieces which are then sucked out through the centre of the needle. The surgeon will then put a lens made of a flexible plastic into the eye. This lens unfolds once it's in the right place inside the capsule in the eye. The cut on the eye often won&rsquo;t need stitches and heals on its own.</p>
<p>The second way of doing the operation is called extracapsular extraction. The surgeon makes a longer cut across the eye. The cloudy lens is removed in one piece. A rigid plastic lens is placed inside the eye. The cut is closed with stitches. These stitches usually need to be taken out later, once the cut has healed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extracapsular extraction isn't done very much any more. Around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Cateracts/3-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">3 in 100</a> people who have cataracts removed have it done by extracapsular extraction.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-20">20</span>]<span id="reference-20" class="content-reference">Hospital Episode Statistics.

Age-related cataract. Lancet. 2005; 365: 599-609.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are in pain once your anaesthetic wears off you can have painkillers. You usually need an antibiotic eye drop to prevent infection and a steroid eye drop to reduce any swelling. You&rsquo;ll have a dressing over your eye for a few hours. Most people go home from hospital the same day.</p>
<p>The artificial lenses come in different strengths, like the lenses in glasses. Your eye specialist chooses a strength of lens that matches your eye. The artificial lens that your surgeon puts in will become part of your eye and won't feel any different from your natural lens.</p>
<p>Different types of replacement lens are available:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-22">22</span>]<span id="reference-22" class="content-reference">NHS Choices.

<li><strong>Monofocal</strong>&nbsp;(fixed-strength), which are set for one level of vision, usually distance vision. You&rsquo;ll need reading glasses for tasks where you have to focus on a short distance.</li>
<li><strong>Multifocal</strong>&nbsp;lenses, which allow two or more different strengths, such as near and distance vision.</li>
<li><strong>Accommodating</strong>&nbsp;lenses, which allow the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, in a similar way to the natural human lens.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can discuss with your ophthalmologist which lens is best for you. Multifocal and accommodating lenses are not usually free on the NHS.</p>

<p>There is no specific level of poor vision that you have to reach before having surgery for a first cataract, and no need to wait for your cataract to get worse.
