<p>Your lungs are in the centre of your chest, behind your ribs. They fill up with air when you breathe in and they empty when you breathe out.&nbsp;This is what happens when you take a breath:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air travels from your mouth down your windpipe and into your lungs.</li>
<li>The air passes into your lungs through a network of tubes (your airways).</li>
<li>These tubes have fine hairs inside them, called cilia.&nbsp;These help to sweep tiny specks of dust, or dirt and germs, out of your lungs.</li>
<li>Your lungs make small amounts of a thick fluid, called mucus (or phlegm). Mucus keeps your airways moist and also helps get rid of dirt and germs.</li>
<li>The air you breathe in ends up in lots of tiny air sacs (called alveoli) inside your lungs.</li>
<li>Each tiny air sac is covered with blood vessels. Oxygen that you breathe in goes through the wall of the tiny air sacs and into your blood vessels.</li>
<li>Your blood takes the oxygen around your body. Oxygen is released into your body's tissues to be used as food.</li>
<li>After your body uses the oxygen, it creates waste gases &ndash; mostly carbon dioxide. The waste gases go from the tissues back into your blood.</li>
<li>Your blood returns to your lungs with these waste gases. When you breathe out you get rid of these waste gases.</li>
</ul></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="119_1_further-info_684"><p>COPD is the name for a group of lung diseases that cause problems with breathing. These lung diseases include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic obstructive lung disease.</p>
<p>If you have COPD, your lungs are probably damaged. Cigarette smoke is usually the cause. Some people get COPD from breathing in harmful chemicals at work or from air pollution.&nbsp;Some people get COPD because they have a genetic problem that is passed down from their parents. This is called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke and other harmful chemicals can irritate the airways in your lungs, making them produce more mucus (phlegm). This stops the fine hairs (cilia) in your airways working properly. This means mucus stays trapped in your lungs instead of being forced out when you cough.</p>
<p>Too much mucus can make the walls of your airways swell and get thicker. When this happens, your airways get narrower. This can make it harder for you to breathe.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke and harmful chemicals can also damage the walls of the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs. This means less of the oxygen you breathe in can get into your blood. Not having enough oxygen in your blood will make you get out of breath and tired quickly.</p></div>

<p>People who have COPD often get a deep chesty cough that brings up lots of mucus (phlegm). This can have a thin or thick texture, and is either clear or a yellow-green colour. The cough is usually worse in the morning or after doing exercise or other physical activities. It may get worse after you smoke a cigarette. If you have COPD you will have a cough that won't go away.</p>

<p>If you have a flare-up of your COPD, you may need different treatments until the flare-up goes away.&nbsp;You will usually need to take oral steroids for a short amount of time. If your flare-up is caused by bacteria you may also need to take antibiotics to treat the infection. Doctors call these treatments rescue medications. During a flare-up, you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find it harder than usual to breathe.</li>
<li>Cough more and bring up more mucus (phlegm). Your mucus will probably be thicker than usual and have more of a yellow-green colour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of people with COPD have flare-ups after they've caught a cold or a chest infection. Flare-ups of COPD aren't always caused by an infection. Some people get flare-ups without having an infection.</p></div>

<p><strong>Air pollution</strong></p>
<p>You have more chance of getting COPD if you live or work in areas with lots of air pollution, such as where there's heavy industry.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Honig HG, Ingram RH.

McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; 2001.</span> These areas will have more harmful particles and gases in the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as outdoor air pollution, burning certain fuels inside your home may increase your chance of getting COPD. A study found that people breathing in wood smoke while doing domestic chores inside the house increased their chance of getting COPD compared to other fuels.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Kurmi OP, Semple S, Simkhada P, et al.

<p><strong>Infections</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have more chance of getting COPD if you get lots of chest infections, especially if you&rsquo;re a smoker. If you get an infection caused by a bacteria or virus, your lungs may produce too much mucus (phlegm). This will make it harder for you to breathe.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Honig HG, Ingram RH.

<p><strong>Your genetic makeup </strong></p>
<p>Some doctors think that the genes people get from their parents increases their chance of getting COPD. We don't know for certain what these genes are. If you&rsquo;re a smoker (or if you used to smoke) and have a relative with COPD, you are more likely to get COPD than another smoker who doesn't have a relative with COPD.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">NHS Choices.

<p>The main test that doctors use to find out if you have COPD is called spirometry.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults in primary and secondary care (partial update). Clinical guideline 101. June 2010. Available at: http://www.nice.org.uk/cg101 (accessed on 22 October 2012).</span> Spirometry is done using a spirometer. During the test, you will be asked to take the biggest breath you can and then blow out as hard as you can into the spirometer. After you&rsquo;ve done the test, you will be asked to breathe in a drug called a bronchodilator. You will then be asked to do the spirometry test again to see if your lungs work any better. This will help your doctor rule out other lung disorders such as asthma.</p>
<p>The spirometer takes two measurements. One is the most amount of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV<sub>1</sub>). The&nbsp;other is the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity, or FVC).&nbsp;These measurements can tell doctors how well your lungs are working. Doctors call this your lung function.</p>
<p>The FEV<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>results are given as a percentage of how much lung function you are expected to have compared with normal measurements.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<ul>
<li>People with COPD who have a FEV<sub>1 </sub>of 80 percent or more have mild COPD (stage 1 COPD).</li>
<li>People with COPD who have a FEV<sub>1 </sub>between 50 percent and 79 percent have moderate COPD (stage 2 COPD).</li>
<li>People with COPD who have a FEV<sub>1 </sub>between 30 percent and 49 percent have severe COPD (stage 3 COPD).</li>
<li>People with COPD who have a FEV<sub>1 </sub>less than 30 percent have very severe COPD (stage 4 COPD).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important that you have a spirometry test. Some doctors have a spirometer in their surgery, but if not you may have to go to hospital for the test.</p>
<p>You may need to have other tests to rule out other illnesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chest x-ray or CT (computer tomography) scan</li>
<li>Blood test for anaemia</li>
<li>Walking test to measure how fast you get out of breath</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram to see if your heart is working properly</li>
<li>Tests to find out how much oxygen or carbon dioxide you have in your blood</li>
<li>Mucus (phlegm) test to see if you have a chest infection.</li>

<p>For most people, COPD slowly gets worse over time. It's difficult to predict what will happen to you because everyone is different. Some people's COPD stays the same for years. For others it gets worse more quickly. The right treatment can help to reduce your symptoms, help your lungs work better for longer, and&nbsp;reduce the number of flare-ups you get.</p>
<p>If your COPD is severe, you will find it hard to breathe and it will take a lot of effort to get air in and out of your lungs. If you can't get enough oxygen into your blood, you will get tired easily and you may be unable to walk very far. Some people with COPD need to breathe extra oxygen. If you're finding it very hard to breathe during a flare-up, you may need a ventilator to help you breathe.</p>

This can be from a doctor, pharmacist, nurse, or trained counsellor.&nbsp;You can have treatment to help you stop smoking at the same time as having professional help.&nbsp;You can also have treatment to help you stop smoking while following a self-management programme, having pulmonary rehabilitation, or taking COPD drugs.</p>
<p>The main treatments to help people stop smoking are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine replacement therapy (or NRT). These treatments work by giving your body a very small amount of nicotine to stop you getting cravings or withdrawal symptoms when you&rsquo;re not smoking. They can come as arm patches, chewing gum, inhalers, tablets that you put under your tongue, lozenges, and nasal sprays. You can buy them from a pharmacy. Your doctor can also prescribe them for you.</li>
<li>Drugs to help you&nbsp;stop smoking. Your doctor can prescribe you two tablet drugs that may help you stop smoking. These are called bupropion and varenicline. Bupropion works by increasing the amounts of two chemicals (called neurotransmitters) that carry messages between your brain cells. This seems to make it easier for people to stop smoking, although we&rsquo;re still not sure exactly how. Varenicline works by blocking the pleasant effects of nicotine in your body. This reduces your craving for cigarettes and can help make it easier for you to stop smoking. You will need to get counselling and advice from a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or a trained counsellor when you use varenicline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other treatments are hypnosis, electronic cigarettes, and self-help guides. These are aids and devices that may help you get over your cigarette cravings.&nbsp;</p>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="119_2_further-info_704_0"><p>A range of drug treatments are used to improve COPD symptoms. Some are taken with an inhaler or nebuliser, so you breathe in the drug as a powder or spray. You should be shown how to use your inhaler or nebuliser correctly. This increases the chances the drug will help you. You can take some drugs&nbsp;combined together&nbsp;in the one inhaler.</p>
<p>Other drugs are taken by mouth as a tablet. The right&nbsp;treatment will depend on the symptoms you get, and how much your lungs have been damaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try different drugs to find out which suits you best. Some people take a combination of drugs for COPD. You may have to take more than one drug combined together in the same inhaler. Some drugs are used only when you have a flare-up of your COPD.</p>
<p><strong>Beta-2 agonists</strong></p>
<p>These are bronchodilator drugs. They relax muscles around your small airways so that more air can get into your lungs. This can make it easier for you to breathe. You need to breathe in these drugs using an inhaler, or sometimes a nebuliser. There are two types of beta-2 agonists: short-acting and long-acting. The short-acting ones work quickly and last for about three to four hours. The long-acting ones last for up to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Beta-2 agonists include salbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, and terbutaline.</p>
<p><strong>Anticholinergics</strong></p>
<p>These are bronchodilator drugs. They relax muscles around your large airways to help more air get into your lungs. This can make it easier for you to breathe. You need to breathe in these drugs using&nbsp;an inhaler or sometimes a nebuliser. There are two types of anticholinergic: short-acting and long-acting. The short-acting ones work quickly and last for about three to four hours. The long-acting ones don't work very quickly, but they last around a day.&nbsp;You usually only need to take long-acting anticholinegics once or twice&nbsp;a day. You usually use short-acting anticholinergics when you're having trouble breathing, or a few times a day to help keep your airways open.</p>
<p>Anticholinergics include ipratropium and tiotropium.</p>
<p><strong>Inhaled corticosteroids (steroids)</strong></p>
<p>These are drugs that you breathe in to reduce the inflammation in your airways. This should make it easier for you to breathe. You usually take inhaled steroids at least twice a day. They work best if you take them regularly. This will help keep the inflammation in your airways under control. You may need to take these drugs over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Inhaled steroids include beclometasone, budesonide, and fluticasone. You can only take these drugs if they are combined in an inhaler with a long-acting beta-2 agonist.</p>
<p><strong>Mucolytic drugs</strong></p>
<p>These are drugs that make the mucus in your lungs thinner, looser, and less sticky. This should help make it easier for you to breathe. You are less likely to get chest infections&nbsp;if you have less mucus in your lungs. Mucolytic drugs usually come as tablets that you take two to four times a day.</p>
<p>Mucolytic drugs include carbocisteine and mecysteine.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue medication</strong></p>
<p>If you have a flare-up of COPD you will usually need to take oral steroids. Sometimes you will also need to take antibiotics. These are both types of drugs that you swallow.</p>
<p>Oral steroids can help you feel less out of breath. Prednisolone is an oral steroid that is commonly used if you have a flare-up of COPD. You are likely to have to take it for seven to 14 days.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are drugs that can kill off bacteria that cause infections in your body, including lung infections. You are usually only given antibiotics if you have a cough that makes you bring up phlegm, and the phlegm has colour or has pus in it. Antibiotics come as capsules, tablets, or as a liquid. These drugs may need to be taken up to 4 times a day for up to 10 days. Antibiotics include amoxicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline.</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen</strong></p>
<p>Breathing in extra oxygen is a treatment you can have if you have severe or very severe COPD and have a lot of damage to your lungs that hasn't been helped by other drugs. If the amount of oxygen in your blood is low, breathing in extra oxygen may help you get more oxygen into your blood. With a better supply of oxygen going to your heart, lungs, and other organs, your body should work and feel better. This may help you to live longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your COPD isn't very severe or you have a healthy amount of oxygen in your blood, breathing in extra oxygen probably won't help you. If you have a flare-up of COPD and you get very out of breath you may be given oxygen for a short time.</p>
<p>Before you have oxygen you may need to have a test called pulse oximetry to check how much oxygen is in your blood. You may be able to have this test at your doctor&rsquo;s surgery, or your doctor can arrange for you to have the test at a hospital. The test will help your doctor tell if you are likely to benefit from having extra oxygen. Your doctor will give you a prescription for the exact amount of extra oxygen to take, if needed. Having too much extra oxygen can sometimes be harmful. You can have oxygen either in hospital or in your own home.</p></div>

<p><strong>Beta-2 agonists</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inhaled steroids</strong></p>

<p>Some studies have found that people who take inhaled steroids for COPD may be more likely to get pneumonia than people who don&rsquo;t take these drugs. A study found that around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/COPD/7-100.jpg" class="image-reference">seven in 100</a> people with COPD who took a high-dose inhaled steroid for six months or more got pneumonia.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-68">68</span>]<span id="reference-68" class="content-reference">Singh S, Amin AV, Loke YK.

Your doctor may keep an eye on this if you take inhaled steroids and then stop taking them.</p>
<p><strong>Mucolytic drugs</strong></p>
<p>These drugs don&rsquo;t seem to cause any unwanted effects other than indigestion. A study found people with COPD were no more likely to have unwanted effects if they took a mucolytic drug than if they didn&rsquo;t take it.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-71">71</span>]<span id="reference-71" class="content-reference">Poole PJ, Black PN.

<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>
<p>Unwanted effects of antibiotics include stomach upsets, queasiness, fever, diarrhoea, and skin rashes.</p>
<p>When people take antibiotics too often, or for too long, bacteria in their body can become resistant to these drugs. If you have bacteria that is resistant to a certain antibiotic, this antibiotic won&rsquo;t work when you take it.</p>
<p>A study of people who had a flare-up of COPD and who took antibiotics and inhaled steroids&nbsp;for seven days found that about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/COPD/4-100.jpg" class="image-reference">four in 100</a> people taking inhaled steroids on their own had an unwanted effect within 30 days of having treatment.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-72">72</span>]<span id="reference-72" class="content-reference">Daniels JM, Snijders D, de Graaff CS, et al.

You can find out about how to manage your illness from your nurse, GP, or your specialist hospital team. You can do this on your own or as part of a group.</p>
<p>Self-management programmes are courses designed to support you to manage your own condition.</p>
<p>A typical self-management programme for COPD can include&nbsp;learning&nbsp;about COPD, getting advice on improving your diet, learning about the best types of exercises you can do to stay healthy, and learning&nbsp;how to spot when your symptoms are getting worse to help you avoid flare-ups. You may also&nbsp;learn about monitoring your COPD and how and when to take your treatments to prevent flare-ups. You may be given a diary to help you plan how you are going to manage your COPD during the programme and afterwards.</p>
<p>A self-management programme for COPD will focus only on COPD. It should take into account your needs and the severity of your disease. It can be held in hospital, at a GP surgery or local clinic, or you may be given information and advice to follow on your own at home.</p>

<p>During pulmonary rehabilitation you will usually learn more about your COPD and how to control your breathing. You will also learn&nbsp;to do&nbsp;exercises for your lungs and learn techniques to help your breathing. The programme usually involves doing light exercise like walking or cycling, and special exercises that strengthen the muscles in your arms and around your lungs. This can help you feel more confident about taking part in exercise and physical activity and worry less about getting out of breath.</p>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes may vary from one hospital to another, but they should be made specific to you and designed to&nbsp;meet your needs.</p>
<p>They&nbsp;can be held in a hospital, with other&nbsp;patients. You will need to attend a few times each week for a few weeks.&nbsp;There are also programmes run in GP practices and local clinics. There may be some programmes that you can do by yourself at home.</p>
<p>You can have pulmonary rehabilitation while you are having other treatments for COPD, such as stopping smoking, taking COPD drugs, or following a self-management programme. You can choose to have a combination of all these options if you prefer.</p></div>

<p>If your breathing feels normal, or if you only start to get out of breath when doing things like walking fast or walking up a slight hill, pulmonary rehabilitation probably won&rsquo;t help you much. If your breathing bothers you more than this, you can have pulmonary rehabilitation to try and improve your breathing.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>You can also have pulmonary rehabilitation if you have had a flare-up of COPD.</p>
<p>Your doctor can help you decide if pulmonary rehabilitation will be useful for you. You doctor might ask you to rate your breathlessness on a five-point scale, called the MRC dyspnoea scale: [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-91">91</span>]<span id="reference-91" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation will probably be useful for you if you have a grade (or score) of 3, 4, or 5 on this scale. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also be useful in some people with a grade of 2. You can discuss this further with your doctor.</p></div>
