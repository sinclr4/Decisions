<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>

<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

Instead, a number of different factors may interact in a way we don&rsquo;t fully understand. Some of these factors may be to do with the way a person thinks, feels and relates to people. Others may be external triggers.</p>
<p>Possible factors involved in depression include:</p>
<p>Biological factors</p>
<p>An imbalance of chemicals in the brain which carry messages from one nerve cell to another (neurotransmitters). The main neurotransmitters in the brain are serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Family history: although there is no clear genetic cause of depression, it is more common in some families than others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stressful life events</p>
<ul>
<li>These may have happened while a person is growing up, or later in life. They include bereavement, break-up of a relationship, loss of a job or home, money problems, alcohol or drug problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationships with other people</p>
<ul>
<li>Falling out with family, friends or work colleagues can lead to feelings of sadness and isolation</li>
<li>Being unable to make friendships or relationships can also result in feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem</li>
<li>Drinking alcohol or taking drugs, such as cannabis, may lead to further breakdown of relationships with family and friends, employment problems, homelessness and worsening depression.</li>

<li>After a very upsetting, difficult or stressful event, such as a bereavement, break up of a relationship, loss of a job or home. This is sometimes called reactive depression.

<li>Childbirth: many new mothers have mood swings in the first few days after having a baby, and about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Depression/10-in-100-and-20-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">10-20 in every 100</a> women continue to have symptoms of depression, including panic attacks, sleep problems and feeling unable to cope, for much longer.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="363_2_further-info_1683_0"><p>Several different types of talking therapies are used to treat depression, on their own or with other treatments for depression. They aim to improve your symptoms and enable you to take part in the everyday activities you enjoyed before you became depressed. This is sometimes called improving the quality of your life. It includes feeling well enough to go to work or college, looking after your family and home, getting involved in social and leisure activities and enjoying being with family and friends.</p>
<p>Talking therapies help you to look at all the factors that may be contributing to your depression, including how your feel and think about things, and lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol, drug taking, gambling, money problems and employment.</p>
<p>The main psychological therapies for depression are [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-61">61</span>]<span id="reference-61" class="content-reference">IAPT. Which talking therapy for depression?; Beating the blues: http://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk</span>:</p>
<p>Counselling</p>
<p>Counselling sees depression mainly as an emotional problem. It aims to help people understand, express and make sense of the feelings underlying their depression. Trained counsellors focus on how you feel and see you as a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; person. They try to understand your &lsquo;world&rsquo; as you see it. Counsellors don&rsquo;t tell you what to do, but they help you explore what you want to talk about, and develop news ways of looking at yourself and the world around you.</p>
<p>Typically people with mild to moderate depression might receive 6-10 counselling sessions over 8-12 weeks, usually once a week for 50-60 minutes. If you need more sessions, you can discuss this with your counsellor.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</p>
<p>This is a psychological treatment that aims to help people change patterns of thinking and behaviour that are causing problems. It helps you reconsider how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and understand how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings. Changing how you think when you are depressed can help you fight negative thoughts, make healthier decisions and take more positive action.</p>
<p>You can have CBT at regular sessions over a period of three to four months. You can have it face to face, with a trained therapist, one-to-one (usually 16-20 sessions) or with other people in a group (usually 10-12 sessions). Sessions include practical exercises with the therapist, and you will get &lsquo;homework&rsquo; to do between session.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Self-help&rsquo; CBT is another way of having treatment. You can do this at home, on the computer, on your own or with support from a trained therapist by telephone or on the internet. This is called computerised CBT (CCBT).</p>
<p>Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)</p>
<p>This type of talking therapy focuses on relationship problems, such as conflicts, life changes, grief and loss, or difficulty in starting or keeping relationships going. IPT helps you find out how you are feeling and behaving in your relationships and, by dealing with problems, you may feel less depressed. You can have IPT on a one-to-one basis with a trained therapist, and agree how many sessions to have (often 16 sessions, sometimes fewer).</p>
<p>Psychodynamic therapy</p>
<p>This is based on the idea that when something is very painful, we try to ignore it or bury it very deeply. Despite this, it can affect the way we feel and how we relate to other people, and lead to depression.</p>
<p>Psychodynamic therapy encourages you to talk about yourself with a trained therapist so you can find out how previous experiences may be affecting the way you feel and act and could be causing your depression. By understanding your feelings, you may be able to change how you respond to certain situations, move on and become better at relating to other people.</p>
<p>You can agree how many sessions of psychodynamic therapy to have with your therapist. Typically, you may have 16 sessions, held once a week for 50 minutes.</p></div>

Antidepressants. http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/treatments/antidepressants.aspx</span>.</p>
<p>The newer antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, tend to have fewer side effects than the older ones, such as the tricyclics, and they are not so dangerous if people take too much of them [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-92">92</span>]<span id="reference-92" class="content-reference">Royal College of Psychiatrists. Antidepressants. http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/treatments/antidepressants.aspx</span>.</p>
<p>Antidepressants are not addictive like tranquillisers, alcohol and nicotine. You don&rsquo;t need to keep increasing the dose to get the same effect, or get cravings if you stop taking them.</p>
<p>When you stop taking SSRIs or SNRIs, you may get withdrawal effects, such as stomach upsets, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, dizziness, vivid dreams or nightmares, sensations like electric shocks.

<p>Side effects of antidepressants include: [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-92">92</span>]<span id="reference-92" class="content-reference">Royal College of Psychiatrists. Antidepressants. http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/treatments/antidepressants.aspx</span>.</p>
<p>Tricyclics: dry mouth, a slight tremor, fast heartbeat, constipation, sleepiness, and weight gain. In older people, they may cause confusion, slowness in starting and stopping when passing water, faintness through low blood pressure, and falls. Men may find it difficult to get or keep erection, or have delayed ejaculation. Tricyclic antidepressants are dangerous in overdose.</p>
<p>SSRIs: nausea and anxiety, especially in the first few weeks, and sexual problems. Indigestion, which may be prevented by taking them with food, and, rarely, aggression.<br />SNRIs: similar to SSRIs. Venlaxine may increase blood pressure and you should not use it if you have a serious heart problem.</p>
<p>MAOIs: dangerously high blood pressure if eaten with foods containing tyramine.</p>
<p>NASSAs: similar to SSRIs, they cause drowsiness, and weight gain, but are less likely to cause sexual problems than SSRIs..</p>
<p>This may seem a long list. Most side effects are mild, and wear off. The more serious ones - problems with urinating, difficulty in remembering, falls, confusion - are uncommon in healthy, younger or middle-aged people.

<p>Sometimes, people with depression think of harming themselves in some way. People with depression under the age of 18 may feel more suicidal if they take SSRIs than if they don&rsquo;t. They shouldn&rsquo;t take this type of antidepressant. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-92">92</span>]<span id="reference-92" class="content-reference">Royal College of Psychiatrists.
