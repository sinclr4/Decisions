            <div class="col left-col"><p>Our Decision Support telephone service is here to&nbsp;assist and guide you through the Shared Decision Making process.</p>
<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Hours Of Operation</p>
<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

<p>This shows how much glucose (sugar) has &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; to the red blood cells in the bloodstream and other important parts of the body, such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels.</p>
<p>HbA1c looks at blood glucose levels over the last 8-12 weeks and so is a good measure of overall diabetes control.</p>
<p>People with an HbA1c between 48 and 58mmol/mol have the lowest risk of getting complications in future. These numbers are sometimes given as percentages, when the safest level is between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Levels over 58mmol/mol (7.5%) may increase the chance of getting complications in future. These include damage to the eyes, nerves or kidneys, as well as heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Levels under 48mmol/mol (6.5%), which can happen with some medications, may increase the chance of having low blood sugars, known as hypoglycaemic episodes, or hypos. When this happens a person may feel shaky, weak and hungry. A really severe hypo can cause drowsiness and confusion, or even loss of consciousness. Fortunately this is rare.</p>
<p>People with Type 2 diabetes usually agree their own safest HbA1c level with their diabetes care team. Usually this will be between 48 and 58mmol/mol (6.5-7.5%).&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">NICE Quality standard for diabetes in adults, March 2011</span></p></div>

<ul>
<li>Eye damage that can lead to blindness</li>
<li>Kidney damage that can be severe enough to need dialysis or a transplant</li>
<li>Damage to the neurological system, especially nerves in the legs and feet. In really bad cases this can lead to amputation</li>
<li>Heart disease, including angina and heart attacks</li>
<li>Poor blood flow to other parts of the body, particularly the legs. This is called peripheral artery disease. In really bad cases it is sometimes necessary to have a leg or foot amputated</li>

</ul>

<p>People who drive cars or motorcycles have to inform the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) when they start taking insulin. They have to renew their licenses every 1-3 years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>People who have Group 2 licences to drive larger vehicles, including large vans, lorries and buses, must inform the DVLA when they start insulin. They will need to stop using their Group 2 licence for at least 3 months whilst they are starting insulin. They may then be able to continue driving using their Group 2 licence, but will need to monitor their diabetes closely and have yearly medical assessments.</p>
<p>People can get further details about driving restrictions from their diabetes teams or the DVLA website.</p></div>
