<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>All women are now offered a screening test for Down's syndrome in pregnancy. It is entirely women&rsquo;s choice whether or not they have this test.&nbsp;The particular test may vary but it will provide an individual risk for the pregnancy taking into account other factors such as age and any previous history of a baby with Down's syndrome.</p>
<p>All women who have a higher chance of a Down&rsquo;s syndrome pregnancy can choose to have a diagnostic test to know for certain if their baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome, or they can choose not to have a test knowing their likelihood of having a baby with Down&rsquo;s syndrome. They should be offered support from a trained professional to explain the results of their screening test and the risks and benefits of diagnostic procedures.</p>
<p>Women who decide to have a diagnostic test may get a negative result that tells them their baby does not have Down&rsquo;s syndrome or a positive result that tells them their baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>
<p>Women who have a positive diagnostic test result can decide to continue their pregnancy knowing their baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome or can decide to terminate their pregnancy.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="332_1_further-info_1463"><p>People with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are born with a learning disability. This means it takes children longer to process information and learn new skills like learning to crawl, walk, speak and read. These learning difficulties are permanent. They cannot be cured but there are supportive therapies which enable many children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome to achieve their potential and lead active, healthy lives. Good healthcare, taking positive action in the first years, access to support in education and good parenting skills are all important in these children&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>Down&rsquo;s syndrome is the most common cause of learning disability. It occurs in 1 in 700 pregnancies.</p>
<p>Most people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome have mild to moderate learning disabilities.&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">NHS Choices. Down&rsquo;s syndrome. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Downs-syndrome/</span></p>
<p>Children with a mild learning disability develop fairly normal language.&nbsp;Most children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome are sociable and engaging, enjoying the same activities as other children. They usually&nbsp;go to mainstream schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children with a moderate learning disability may have more problems with language and may need more support for longer in developing skills of daily living (such as washing and dressing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome have more severe learning disabilities. &nbsp;This may mean, for example, that they do not use much spoken language. Or they may need support of daily activities such as washing.&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Department of Work and Pensions. Learning Disability. What are the effects and signs?</span>&nbsp;It is not possible to determine the extent of any learning disability from the diagnostic test done during pregnancy.</p>
<p>However there is no such thing as a typical person with Down&rsquo;s syndrome. People born with Down&rsquo;s syndrome develop differently from each other and have different life experiences.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="332_1_further-info_1464"><p>Down&rsquo;s syndrome happens as a result of an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are structures inside the body&rsquo;s cells which carry the genes that determine how we develop. &nbsp;A baby usually inherits 23 chromosomes from each parent, making a total of 46.</p>
<p>In Down&rsquo;s syndrome the baby inherits an extra copy of a chromosome called the 21 chromosome. The baby has 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This extra chromosome explains why babies with Down&rsquo;s syndrome develop differently from babies without this extra chromosome.. It can come from either the mother or the father.</p>
<p>This happens by chance in about 1 in 700 pregnancies. It is not caused by anything the parents have done.</p>
<p>No one knows for certain why some babies have an extra chromosome 21. The chance of this happening increases as a woman gets older.&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-3">3</span>]<span id="reference-3" class="content-reference">Down&rsquo;s syndrome. NHS Choices. http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Downs-syndrome</span>.

<p>Children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome may also have more difficulties sleeping and more digestive problems (such as constipation) and they may also be more vulnerable to infection, than other children.</p>

<p>There is no longer the expectation that a child with Down&rsquo; syndrome will be living with his or her parents for life. With adequate help and support, many adults with Down&rsquo;s syndrome can live on their own or with someone else. There are a range of supported living services available&nbsp;for adults with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Many young adults with Down&rsquo;s syndrome go into further education and some get employment, usually part-time. Many enter relationships although they will need guidance and support around issues such as contraception or having children.</p>
<p>Older people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome face similar challenges of getting older as the rest of the population. These include retirement (if they have been working), bereavement (losing family and friends) and moving home. These changes can lead to feelings of confusion, disorientation and depression.</p>
<p>People with Down&rsquo;s syndrome tend to develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease at an earlier age than the rest of the population. Alzheimer&rsquo;s is the main type of dementia and causes increasing memory loss.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="332_2_further-info_1499_0"><p>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test which can be carried out in pregnancy to check if the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome. Sometimes it is used to check for other conditions. It is called a diagnostic test, which means it can say for certain if the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome or not.</p>
<p>In CVS, a small piece of tissue is removed from the placenta. The sample of tissue is sent to a laboratory, so that the baby&rsquo;s chromosome can be examined.</p>
<p>CVS can be carried out in two ways. Usually it is done through the abdomen (tummy). This is called &ldquo;transdominal CVS&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Immediately before the test, the abdomen will be cleaned with antiseptic. A small amount of local anaesthetic (painkiller) will be injected into the skin, to numb the area.</p>
<p>Using the ultrasound scan for guidance, a long needle is guided through your skin, into the womb and the placenta. A syringe attached to the end of the needle allows a sample of tissue from the placenta to be drawn (sucked) up into the syringe. Afterwards the needle is taken out and your baby is observed on the ultrasound.</p>
<p>Sometimes because of the position of your womb or the position of the placenta, transabdominal CVS may not be possible. CVS can also be performed by passing a fine plastic tube or biopsy forceps through your cervix (the neck of your womb). This is known as "transcervical CVS". This type of CVS may carry more risk of miscarriage than when the needle goes through the abdomen.</p>
<p>The test takes only a few minutes but the preparation can take a little longer so you should prepare to be in the clinic for about an hour.</p></div>

<p>Women may wish to ask the doctor how many such procedures he or she carries out annually, to help them make a decision.</p>
<p>Your hospital should also keep a record of their miscarriage rate following CVS, to be sure that it is no higher than expected.</p></div>

<li>A &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; test which only tests for chromosomes linked to specific disorders. This test can be used to detect Down&rsquo;s syndrome. It is called a PCR (short for polymerase chain reaction) test. The results of this test are usually ready within three working days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where and when you receive the results will be discussed with you by the staff in the unit doing the test. You may wish to think carefully about how you want to hear this information and who you may want to have with you.</p>
<p>There are national guidelines which say you should be informed of the result within one working day of it being received from the laboratory by the hospital. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-24">24</span>]<span id="reference-24" class="content-reference">Screening for Down&rsquo;s syndrome: UK NSC Policy recommendations 2011-2014 Model of Best Practice</span>. You should be told the results by a trained professional such as your midwife or doctor.</p>
<p>For most women, the laboratory test will definitely say whether the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome or not. Sometimes the result is unclear and a repeat test or an amniocentesis is offered.</p>
<p>Very occasionally women who have a CVS for Down&rsquo;s syndrome find out that their baby has a different abnormality. If this happens to you, your doctor or midwife will give you information on the condition your baby has and the chance to discuss this with a specialist.</p>
<p>The test can only say whether or not the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome. It will not be able to tell you how your baby is affected or how severe his or her condition is.</p>
<p>There are standards laid down to ensure that the results of the laboratory tests are reliable.

<p>Sometimes after a CVS, both normal and abnormal cells are detected in the tissue from the placenta. It is not clear if the baby is affected by the abnormality, or if it is just the placenta. This is called placental mosaicism. It affects between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Diagnostic-testing-for-Downs-syndrome/1-and-2-100.jpg" class="image-reference">1 and 2 in every 100</a> women who have CVS.</p>
<p>If your CVS detects a mosaicism, you may be offered an amniocentesis and possibly other testing to find out if the abnormality affects the baby.

<p>What if my baby has Down's syndrome?</p>
<p>If your baby is found to have Down&rsquo;s syndrome, there are two options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some women and their partners will decide to continue with the pregnancy, make plans and prepare for bringing up a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome</li>
<li>Some women will decide they wish to end the pregnancy and choose a termination.</li>

<p>Before having the test for Down&rsquo;s syndrome, many women do not know for sure what they would want to do if the diagnosis was positive.</p>

<p>We have outlined some of these standards below. This will help you know what should happen and whether you are getting the best care.</p>
<p>For example, the policy documents say</p>
<ul>
<li>The aims, benefits and risks of CVS should be fully explained to you by a trained professional</li>
<li>You should also be given written information about amniocentesis and enough time to read it before being asked to consent</li>
<li>The test should only go ahead after you have given written and informed consent</li>
<li>Your privacy should be respected and the discussion and the test itself should take place in a room where privacy is assured</li>
<li>You should be told the result by a trained professional</li>
</ul>
<p>And:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVS should not be performed before 10 weeks of pregnancy</li>
<li>CVS should be performed with continuous ultrasound scanning</li>

It is called a diagnostic test which means it can say for certain if the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome or not.</p>
<p>In amniocentesis a fine needle is used to remove a small amount of the fluid (called amniotic fluid) which surrounds your baby inside the womb (uterus). The genetic information in the amniotic fluid is the same as that in the cells of the unborn baby. The fluid is sent to a laboratory so that the baby&rsquo;s chromosomes can be examined.</p>
<p>Immediately before the test, the abdomen (tummy) will be cleaned with antiseptic. Ultrasound is used to monitor the position of the baby and the needle throughout the test.</p>
<p>Using the ultrasound scan for guidance, a long needle is guided through your skin, through your tummy into the fluid in the womb. A syringe attached to the other end of the needle is used to draw off a small amount of the fluid around the baby (usually between 10 and 20mls, or about 2-4 teaspoonfuls).</p>
<p>The baby will quickly start to replace the amniotic fluid that is removed during the procedure. Afterwards the needle is taken out and your baby is observed on the ultrasound.</p>
<p>The doctor doing the test will usually try to avoid inserting the needle through the placenta. However, occasionally, this can be the only way to collect the sample of fluid. If the needle does pass through the placenta it does not appear to increase the risk to the baby&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

<ul>
<li>A test which checks all the baby&rsquo;s chromosomes. This is called a full karyotype. The results fom this test are usually ready in two or three weeks [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Amniocentesis and Chorionic Villus Sampling. Green-top Guideline No.8. June 2010.</span></li>
<li>A &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; test which only tests for chromosomes linked to specific disorders. This test can be used to detect Down&rsquo;s syndrome. It is called a PCR (short for polymerase chain reaction) test. The results of this test are usually ready within three working days.</li>
</ul>
<p>How will I get my results?</p>
<p>Where and when you receive the results will be discussed with you by the staff in the unit doing the test. You may wish to think carefully about how you want to hear this information and who you may want to have with you.</p>
<p>There are national guidelines which say you should be informed of the result within one working day of it being received from the laboratory by the hospital.&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-24">24</span>]<span id="reference-24" class="content-reference">Screening for Down&rsquo;s syndrome: UK NSC Policy recommendations 2011-2014 Model of Best Practice</span>&nbsp;You should be told the results by a trained professional such as your midwife or doctor.</p>
<p>What will the results tell me?</p>
<p>For most women, the laboratory test will definitely say whether the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome or not. Sometimes the result is unclear and a repeat test is needed.</p>
<p>Very occasionally women who have an amniocentesis for Down&rsquo;s syndrome find out that their baby has a different chromosomal abnormality. If this happens to you, your doctor or midwife will give you information on the condition your baby has and the chance to discuss this with a specialist.</p>
<p>Can amniocentesis tell how severely a baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome?</p>
<p>The test can only say whether or not the baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome. It will not be able to tell you how your baby is affected or how severe his or her condition is.</p>
<p>How can I be sure the test is reliable?</p>
<p>There are standards laid down to ensure that the results of the laboratory tests are reliable.

<p>In a small number of cases it may be that the amniocentesis identifies a problem in the baby&rsquo;s chromosomes which is of importance but which is not Down&rsquo;s syndrome. &nbsp;The particular result will be explained to you in more detail by the unit providing you with your result. Bear in mind that a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; result does not guarantee your baby will not have other health problems. Not all of these can be detected by the amniocentesis test.</p>
<p>What if my unborn baby has Down&rsquo;s syndrome?</p>
<p>If the unborn baby is found to have Down&rsquo;s syndrome, there are two options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some women and their partners will decide to continue with the pregnancy, make plans and prepare for bringing up a child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome</li>
<li>Some women will decide they wish to end the pregnancy and choose a termination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before having the test for Down&rsquo;s syndrome, many women do not know for sure what they would want to do if the diagnosis was positive.</p>
<p>Only you, together with your partner, can decide what is right for you.</p></div>

Policy, Standards and Protocols. April 2008</span>. They are intended to ensure this procedure is carried out as safely as possible. The standards also advise hospitals to make sure you have enough information and time to make a decision about amniocentesis and that you feel supported in making that decision.</p>
<p>We have outlined some of these standards below. This will help you know what should happen and whether you are getting the best care.</p>
<p>For example, the policy documents say</p>
<ul>
<li>The aims, benefits and risks of amniocentesis should be fully explained to you by a trained professional</li>
<li>You should also be given written information about amniocentesis and enough time to read it before being asked to consent</li>
<li>The test should only go ahead after you have given written and informed consent</li>
<li>Your privacy should be respected and the discussion and the test itself should take place in a room where privacy is assured</li>
<li>You should be told the result by a trained professional</li>
</ul>
<p>And:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amniocentesis should not be performed before 15 weeks of pregnancy</li>
<li>Amniocentesis should be performed with continuous ultrasound scanning</li>
<li>The doctor should only insert the needle through the placenta if this is the only way to obtain amniotic fluid</li>
<li>Amniocentesis should only be carried out by someone after adequate training</li>
