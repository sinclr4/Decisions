<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>

<p>People considering being cared for at home in the last months of life also need to take into account how much professional support and care can be provided. This will vary according to where they live. In many areas, the GP and District Nurse will provide most of the care. They can arrange for community palliative care nurses (such as Macmillan nurses), to visit people&rsquo;s homes to provide specialist care including advice on how to control symptoms, and practical and emotional support. Some areas have Hospice at Home services. This allows people to receive hospice care in their own home.&nbsp;The District Nurse can also arrange for care from the Marie Curie Nursing Service and support from some social care agencies.</p>
<p>The social services department of the local authority may provide a range of social care services and equipment to help terminally ill people remain at home.</p>
<p>Another factor which many people consider in deciding whether to be cared for at home is whether the home environment is suitable, especially if someone has a progressive illness. For example, the rooms may be thought too small to contain a lot of equipment or there may be stairs which someone who is ill finds difficult to use.</p></div>

<p>Below are some other findings from the survey, from the relatives of those who had been cared for at home.</p>
<p>Relief of pain</p>
<p>Bereaved relatives were asked how well pain was relieved in those who had been cared for at home (and who were in pain). <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/17-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">Seventeen in 100</a> said that pain relief was provided all the time. <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/70-100.jpg" class="image-reference">Thirty in 100</a> said that pain relief was provided some of the time.</p>
<p>Dignity and respect</p>
<p>Bereaved relatives were asked whether the person being cared for at home was shown dignity and respect at all time. <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/21-100.jpg" class="image-reference">Seventy-nine in 100</a> said that the person had been shown dignity and respect all of the time by district and community nurses. <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/72-28.jpg" class="image-reference">Seventy-two in 100</a> said the person had been shown dignity and respect all of the time by GPs.</p>

<p><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/92-08.jpg" class="image-reference">Ninety-two in 100</a> relatives felt that the person being cared for had been involved in decisions about their care as much as they had wanted.</p>

<p>Over <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/80-100.jpg" class="image-reference">80 in 100</a> relatives said that in the last two days of life, the personal and nursing care needs of the person being cared for had been met. <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/end-of-life/92-08.jpg" class="image-reference">Ninety-two in 100</a> felt that their relative had had adequate privacy in the last stages.</p></div>

Someone may have been living in a care home and consider it their home before they are thought to be in the last year or months of life.&nbsp;Care homes are for people who find it difficult to look after themselves, where it is not possible to receive the care they need in their own home. Care homes provide personal care including help with washing, toileting and help to take medication. Staff are available day and night. People may have their own rooms, with a lounge and other communal areas.</p>
<p>Care homes vary in the type of environment. Some residential homes have a homely atmosphere and encourage people to bring in some of their own furniture and even their pets.</p>
<p>Nursing care homes offer skilled nursing care for people who are very frail or who have a disability or a serious long term condition and need frequent medical attention from a doctor or nurse. Other homes offer specialist care for people with conditions such as dementia.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all residential homes will keep people at the end of life, whereas all nursing homes will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>End of life care in a care home may involve the local hospital's palliative care team, the local hospice team, the GP, community nurses and district nurses. Palliative care is the type of care provided to someone who has a life limiting or terminal illness. It concentrates on helping them live as well as possible and making them as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>Care homes can be run by voluntary organisations, private individuals, private companies or local councils.</p></div>

<p>If someone is already resident in a care home, they can choose to remain there for all their end of life care.</p>
<p>The NHS advises that when considering a care home for end of life care, someone should ask if it is accredited by the NHS end of life Gold Standards Framework, which means that the home has staff who are especially trained in end of life care and good links with professionals such as GPs.</p>
<p>Care homes charge a fee for their services. How someone pays depends on their personal situation. The local council may be able to pay all or part of the fees if someone&rsquo;s capital and savings are below a certain limit. Someone who is relying on local authority funding, will not be able to be cared for in a home that costs more than the authority is prepared to pay, unless they or their family can pay the difference.</p></div>

<li>physiotherapy</li>
<li>rehabilitation (helping someone build up their health and strength, for example through exercise)</li>

<p>Hospices have beds for people who are being cared for in the hospice itself, but a hospice team can also provide hospice care to people at home, or in a care home.</p>
<p>Hospices aim to provide a homely atmosphere and encourage people to bring their own belongings during their stay. They also encourage visits from family and friends.&nbsp;Many inpatient hospices are run by charities.</p></div>

People can use hospice care at any stage in their illness, not just the end of life.

<p>Whether people can access hospice care or a hospice depends on what level of palliative care they need at the end of life. A GP or hospital doctor can refer someone for hospice care.&nbsp;Hospices are free for people using them.</p>

<p>Hospitals are a &ldquo;medical&rdquo; environment. Some try to create a more homely atmosphere and encourage people to bring in their belongings and photos to make their stay more personal, as a reminder of home. Access to family and friends will depend on each hospital&rsquo;s policy but as someone approaches the end of life most allow unlimited visiting and may provide overnight facilities.</p>
<p>All hospitals have specialist palliative care teams who help hospital staff to care for patients nearing the end of their life. Palliative care concentrates on relieving distressing symptoms and providing whatever support the patient and their family needs, rather than on cure. It is also called holistic care since it deals with the whole person, rather than just with one aspect of their care.<br />In many cases people nearing the end of life need to go into hospital for short periods for treatment. For example, cancer patients may need chemotherapy and radiotherapy to help control their symptoms, but most of the time they will be encouraged to be at home.</p></div>

<p>Sometimes, people and their families change their minds about where they would like to be in the last days or weeks of life. If an illness gets worse, they may feel they will be better cared for and more comfortable in hospital.

                                            <p>This decision aid is to help adults who are considering the place where they, or a family member or companion, would like to be cared for as they approach the end of life. In this decision aid, end of life means the last months or year of a person's life.</p>
<p>People making this decision will be at a stage in their life where they wish to plan where they will be cared for. They may have a terminal or life limiting illness or they may simply have reached a stage in life where they wish to make plans about their care, in advance. The options about where to have this end of life care are:</p>
<ul>
<li>At home</li>
<li>In a care home, which may be your home already</li>
<li>In a hospice</li>
<li>In a hospital</li>
</ul>
<p>Making a decision about preferred place of care as the end of life approaches can be difficult but doing so in advance will make it more likely that people's wishes are met. The decision depends on people's own living arrangements and finances, their health, the friends, family and carers they have in their lives, their preferences for care at the end of life, and the services available in their local area.</p>
<p>This decision aid will help you think about what is important to you and your family when considering where to have end of life care. It may be helpful to start talking about these options with your family, carers, doctors and other health professionals.</p>
<p>The issues people think about when deciding where they would like to be cared for at the end of life include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is one place better for me than another if I am having treatment for a health problem?</li>
<li>Is one place better for me than another for access to emergency treatment?</li>
<li>Is one place better for me than another for treatment to control my symptoms?</li>
</ul>
<p>The right choice for you may change over time. This decision aid aims to help you make the right choice for you now, but you may wish to change your mind as your life changes.</p>                    </div>

It helps people with advanced, progressive or incurable illness, to live as well as possible until they die. End of life care also includes support for people&rsquo;s partners, families and informal carers both before and after someone&rsquo;s death.

<p>When end of life care begins depends on someone&rsquo;s needs. It may last a few days or many months. End of life care begins when someone needs it and continues for as long as they need it.</p>
<p>End of life care includes palliative care. This is care which concentrates on relieving symptoms rather than on cure. It provides whatever support is needed to the patient and their family. The support may be physical, psychological, social, spiritual or practical. It is based on the individual care needs of the patient and their family. This kind of care is a form of holistic care because it deals with the whole person, rather than just with one aspect of their care. Palliative care was originally developed by hospices but this approach is also used in other settings.</p>
<p>People who are considering the place they would like to be cared for towards the end of life may have a progressive or life limiting illness, or they may have reached a stage in life where they want to think about how they wish to be cared for in the future. Someone in this position has the opportunity to discuss and plan how and where they wish to be cared for in advance. These discussions can take place with health professionals such as the GP or hospital doctor and they also include people&rsquo;s families and informal carers.&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-4">4</span>]<span id="reference-4" class="content-reference">Department of Health.

<li>In someone&rsquo;s own home (or in the home of a relative or friend). Some people prefer to remain at home for end of life care. The main carer here is usually a family member, with some support provided by health and social care professionals.</li>
<li>A care home. Care homes can be run by voluntary or private organisations or by local councils.</li>
<li>An inpatient hospice. This is a specialist unit which focuses on supporting people who are terminally ill and their families. Hospice care can also be provided in hospitals, people&rsquo;s homes and care homes.</li>
<li>In hospital. All hospitals have specialist palliative care teams who help hospital staff provide care for people nearing the end of life.</li>

<p>If someone has a terminal or life limiting illness, it can be a good idea to consider in advance where they would like to be cared for in the final months or year of life. Planning ahead in this way is sometimes called advance care planning. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-36">36</span>]<span id="reference-36" class="content-reference">NHS Choices. Planning ahead for the end of life. www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life care/Pages/planning-ahead</span></p>
<p>People usually carry out advance care planning because they have a condition that is expected to get worse. They may become too ill to be able to decide how and where they wish to be cared for, or to communicate their decisions in the future. However, anyone can make plans for their future care, whether they are approaching the end of life, or not.</p>
<p>It can make things easier for their family to know someone&rsquo;s wishes in advance. It means relatives may not have to make difficult decisions on their own, later on.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="399_1_further-info_1756"><p>Most people start by thinking about what they might want for end of life care and talking about it with their family and health professionals.</p>
<p>Someone can write down their preferences for end of life care, in a care plan, or an advance care plan. They can also write an advance statement about their preferences for future care including where they would like it to take place. The statement can be a future guide to anyone who might have to make decisions about someone&rsquo;s care, in their best interests, if they lose the capacity to make decisions or to communicate them.</p>
<p>An advance statement is not legally binding but anyone making decisions about a person's care must take it into account. That person can decide where it is kept and who sees it or knows where it is. <br />It may help to read the booklet Planning for your future care: a guide [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-37">37</span>]<span id="reference-37" class="content-reference">http://www.endoflifecare.nhs.uk/assets/downloads/EoLC_Planning_for_your_future_care_FINAL_010212.pdf</span> produced by the National End of Life Care Programme.</p>
<p>In the UK there are some schemes which aim to help more people receive end of life care in their preferred place. For example, the Electronic Palliative Care Coordination Systems (EPaCCS) is an electronic means of recording people&rsquo;s wishes about end of life care, so that they are known about by all relevant health professionals. It is worth asking the GP if the practice is using EPaCCS, or another end of life care register.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="399_1_further-info_1758"><p>It is possible to decide whether a person might wish to refuse any types of treatment in the future. This is called an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (an ADRT, in the past also called a living will).&nbsp;For example, someone may decide not to have a treatment to keep them alive longer if they felt the treatment did not add to the quality of their life.&nbsp;Examples might include ventilation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which can be used if someone cannot breathe by themselves or if their heart stops, or a machine to help the kidneys work properly (dialysis).</p>
<p>A person may wish to discuss this with a doctor or nurse who knows their medical history, before making up their mind whether they would wish to have these treatments in future. More information about advance decisions can be found at [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/advance-decision-to-refuse-treatment.aspx</span>.</p>
<p>If someone becomes unable to make decisions in the future, someone will need to make decisions for them. Who does this will depend on the situation. Generally, professionals will make decisions about someone&rsquo;s health and social care, and their family or carers will decide on the more day-to-day matters.</p>
<p>It is possible to officially appoint someone trusted to make decisions on someone's behalf, in advance. This is called making a lasting power of attorney (LPA). This enables someone to give another person the right to make decisions about their care and welfare.</p>
<p>There are special rules about appointing a lasting power of attorney. The Office of the Public Guardian has guidance for people who want to make a lasting power of attorney [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-39">39</span>]<span id="reference-39" class="content-reference">http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/forms/opg/lpa-guidance-health-and-welfare.pdf</span>.<br />Someone approaching the end of life may also wish to make a will, which enables them to decide what happens to their money, property and possessions after their death. It will need to be formally witnessed and signed to make it legally valid.
