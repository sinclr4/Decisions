<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

                <div data-cms-content-id="51_1_further-info_220"><p>The kidneys are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are just below your ribcage, one on either side of your spine, at the back of the body. Every day the kidneys filter about 200 litres of fluid, removing 2 to 3 litres (more than 3 to 5 pints) of water and waste products from the blood. If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body.</p>
<p>Blood is moved through the kidneys in blood vessels. Tiny filters within the kidneys act like a sieve. They keep proteins and cells in the blood where they are needed. Extra fluid and waste is passed to the bladder in urine. The bladder stores urine until you go to the toilet. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is needed to make red blood cells. Healthy kidneys help keep your blood pressure stable. And kidneys are important for absorbing the right amount of calcium and phosphate, which helps keep your bones strong.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="51_1_further-info_221"><p>Chronic kidney disease means your kidneys are gradually losing their ability to filter waste products out of your blood.</p>
<p>You may also hear it called&nbsp;<strong>chronic renal failure</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>chronic kidney failure</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>chronic renal insufficiency</strong>. Chronic means it&rsquo;s a long-term condition, and renal means it involves your kidneys.</p>
<p>Doctors use the term&nbsp;<strong>kidney function</strong>&nbsp;as a way to describe how well your kidneys filter blood. Kidney function can be measured with a blood test. Young people with two healthy kidneys usually have around 90 percent to 100 percent of their kidney function. Your kidney function tends to get lower with age. This isn&rsquo;t usually a problem, unless it keeps on getting lower.</p>
<p>People can lose some of their kidney function without it causing any problems or symptoms. But health problems begin when the kidneys can no longer do all their jobs well enough. When this happens varies from person to person. Some people might get symptoms when they still have quite a lot of kidney function, while others don&rsquo;t get symptoms even though they have lost more kidney function.</p></div>

If your blood tests show kidney function of 15 percent or less, this is called chronic kidney disease stage 5, also known as established kidney failure. You may also hear it called end stage kidney failure.</p>
<p>If you have established kidney failure, you may get symptoms because of waste building up in your blood. But this doesn&rsquo;t happen to everyone. You may not get symptoms until your kidney function is much lower than 15 percent.</p></div>

<p>Serum creatinine measures a chemical in the blood. It is used to calculate what is called the estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR for short). The eGFR calculation is a calculation of how much blood your kidneys are able to filter in one minute. This number is about the same as your kidney function. So if you have 100 percent kidney function, your eGFR is also likely to be 100.</p>
<p>Your eGFR is used by doctors to put your kidney disease into &lsquo;stages&rsquo;.&nbsp; There are five stages of kidney disease. If you have completely normal kidney function, you have an eGFR of 90 or over. If you have an eGFR between 15 and 90, you have some kidney damage (stages 1 to 4).</p>
<p>If your eGFR is less than 15, you have chronic kidney disease stage 5, which is established kidney failure.</p></div>

Dialysis is a treatment that removes the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, you are attached to a machine that takes unfiltered blood from your body, and removes the waste, before the blood is transferred back into your body. You usually need haemodialysis at least three times a week, for at least four hours each session. However, the amount of time varies from person to person.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Chronic kidney disease quality standard. November 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qualitystandards/chronickidneydisease/ckdqualitystandard.jsp (accessed on 20 April 2012).</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having <strong>haemodialysis in clinic or hospital</strong> means you will travel to your nearest dialysis unit to have your dialysis. Usually staff at the unit will handle the dialysis.&nbsp;Some hospitals have units where you can go to do your haemodialysis yourself, with help from the staff if you need it.</p>
<p>You can change your mind about where you have haemodialysis. If you start having haemodialysis in a clinic, you could switch to having it done at home later on.</p>
<p>You will need to have two needles inserted for haemodialysis, so that blood can be removed from your body and then put back in. After the needles are in place, tubing is attached and connected to the dialysis machine. Blood flows out of your body through one needle to the dialysis machine, and then back into your body through another.</p>
<p>The blood that is taken from your body is cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. Dialysis uses a membrane as a filter. Dialysis fluid (also called dialysis solution, or dialysate) controls the balance of fluid, salts, and minerals in your blood. The membrane has tiny holes that the excess fluid and substances in the blood pass through to be taken away in the dialysis fluid.</p>
<p>You need to sit or lie down while you are attached to the machine for treatment. You can read, work, or even do sitting-down exercises.</p>
<p>The first step before starting haemodialysis is to create an easy point of access to your blood vessels, called a vascular access point. This is so blood can flow in and out of your body. It is done before you begin dialysis treatment.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-8">8</span>]<span id="reference-8" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Chronic kidney disease quality standard. November 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qualitystandards/chronickidneydisease/ckdqualitystandard.jsp (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span> This makes dialysis quicker and easier, and reduces the risk of problems.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of vascular access - an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, an AV graft, and a venous catheter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AV fistulas</strong></p>
<p>A surgeon creates an AV fistula by connecting an artery directly to a vein, usually in your arm. For the surgery, you&rsquo;ll usually be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area where the fistula is being created. Most people don&rsquo;t need to stay in hospital for the operation.</p>
<p>Connecting the artery to the vein causes more blood to flow into the vein. As a result, the vein grows larger and stronger, making it easier for blood to pass in and out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This operation should be done several months before you start dialysis, because it takes time for the vein to grow. A fistula is less likely than other kinds of vascular access to form blood clots or become infected.&nbsp; It should last for many years, and usually longer than any other kind of vascular access.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-9">9</span>]<span id="reference-9" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Vascular access for haemodialysis. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/vascularaccess/index.aspx (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span></p>
<p><strong>AV grafts</strong></p>
<p>If your veins don&rsquo;t develop into an adequate fistula, you can get a tube - called a graft - instead. A graft connects an artery to a vein and is implanted under the skin in your arm. The graft becomes an artificial vein that can be used during haemodialysis. A graft doesn&rsquo;t need to grow in the way a fistula does, so it can be used sooner, often within two or three weeks. Compared with properly formed fistulas, grafts tend to have more problems with clotting and infection and need replacement sooner.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-9">9</span>]<span id="reference-9" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Vascular access for haemodialysis. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/vascularaccess/index.aspx (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span> However, a well-cared-for graft can last several years.</p>
<p><strong>Catheters</strong></p>
<p>If your kidney disease has worsened quickly, you may not have time to get a permanent vascular access before you start haemodialysis. A venous catheter can be used as a temporary access.</p>
<p>A catheter is a soft flexible plastic tube inserted into a vein in your neck, chest, or leg near the groin. It has two channels to allow a two-way flow of blood.</p>
<p>Catheters are not ideal for permanent access. They can clog, become infected, and cause narrowing of the veins in which they are placed. But if you need to start haemodialysis immediately, a catheter will work for several weeks or months while a permanent access develops. Some people are not able to have a permanent AV fistula or graft, and so need to have a catheter inserted permanently. Some people choose to have a permanent catheter to avoid having to use needles, or having an operation to insert a graft.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other treatments</strong></p>
<p>If you need haemodialysis, you are likely to need other medical treatments as well. You may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Injections of drugs called erythropoietin to treat anaemia</li>
<li>Phosphate binders</li>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Insulin, if you have diabetes.</li>

<p>People who have haemodialysis in a hospital or clinic seem less likely to live for at least 10 years, compared with people who have haemodialysis at home. But that could be because people having haemodialysis at home are fitter to start with.

<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible for you to work while having dialysis. But it is likely that working during dialysis will mean adjustments for you, your employer, and your family.</p>
<p>Dialysis can make you feel extremely tired, and this may prevent you from working. Employers are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to allow you to work, and this can include giving you time off to attend appointments.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong> you will need to make time for your dialysis sessions. It may be possible for you to work around your dialysis. If you have haemodialysis in hospital or a dialysis unit, they should do all they can to arrange your appointments so that your treatment can fit in with your work schedule. But dialysis appointments are often during the day and this may make it more difficult to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>If you have haemodialysis, you will usually have treatment in hospital at least three times a week. But you don't usually need hospital treatment between sessions. You have some time for days out, short holidays, and other activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Many people who are on dialysis feel out of breath and extremely tired. But some people find regular and moderate exercise helps, if they can manage it. Exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming may be suitable for people on dialysis. A study of people on dialysis showed that people who exercised up to five times a week lived longer than other people on dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-27">27</span>]<span id="reference-27" class="content-reference">Stack AG, Molony DA, Rives T, et al.

<ul>
<li><strong>Tiredness. </strong>Haemodyalisis can make you feel exhausted and short of breath immediately after treatment.

<li><strong>Itchy skin and muscle cramps. </strong>The <strong>itchy skin</strong> is thought to be because of a build up of phosphate in your blood. The <strong>muscle cramps</strong> often happen in your lower legs as your muscles adjust to the fluid loss during dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs</strong>. People having haemodialysis sometimes get restless legs. This means that they have a strong urge to move their legs caused by an unpleasant feeling in these limbs. This feeling is worse when they are not active and at night.<span class="content-reference">Kavanagh D, Siddiqui S, Geddes CC. Restless legs syndrome in patients on dialysis.

<li><strong>Low blood pressure. </strong>This can be caused by the sudden drop in fluid levels that happens during dialysis. Low blood pressure can make you feel sick and dizzy during or soon after dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>. People on any type of dialysis may not have the right amounts of minerals like calcium and phosphorus. This can cause pain in the bones and joints, weaker bones, and may make you more likely to have fractures and broken bones.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse.

<p><strong>Problems with vascular access points</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, all three types of vascular access points can have problems that need further treatment or surgery.

<p>If you have haemodialysis, you will probably need to be attached to a dialysis machine at least three times a week, for four or more hours each time. However, the amount of time varies from person to person. You can&rsquo;t get up and move around while this is happening. You will also need blood tests and checks, to see whether your treatment is working well enough. These tests and checks may have to be done in a hospital or clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>All types of dialysis involve some restrictions to your diet and what you can drink. This can take some adjustment for you and any family members who help prepare your meals. You will be able to speak to a dietitian or other member of your health care team to discuss how best to make changes to your diet.</p>
<p>Most people having haemodialysis need to adjust their diet. The restrictions on your diet and how much fluid you drink can be quite strict.</p>
<p>People on haemodialysis may be encouraged to eat high-quality <strong>protein</strong> from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-37">37</span>]<span id="reference-37" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse. Haemodialysis. December 2011. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/hemodialysis/index.aspx#diet (accessed 18 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>You may need to cut down on foods high in <strong>potassium</strong>, <strong>phosphate</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong>.</p>
<p>You will need to restrict how much fluid you drink. This is needed because your body will gradually make less and less urine once you are having haemodialysis. Excess fluid is taken out during dialysis sessions, but it can build up between sessions, causing puffiness. It can damage your tissues if this happens long-term. So you need to ensure you are not taking in more fluid than you&rsquo;re getting rid of in urine.</p>
<p>Fluid intake is different for each individual. A rough guide for fluid intake is half a litre (just under a pint) of fluid more than the volume of urine that is passed each day. This is usually equivalent to a limit of around a litre of fluid (about one and three quarter pints) a day.&nbsp;</p></div>

Dialysis is a treatment that removes the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Haemodialysis</strong></p>
<p>During haemodialysis, you are attached to a machine that takes unfiltered blood from your body, and removes the waste, before the blood is transferred back into your body. You will probably need haemodialysis at least three times a week, for at least four hours each session. However, the amount of time varies from person to person.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>You will need to have two needles inserted for haemodialysis, so that blood can be removed from your body and then put back in. After the needles are in place, tubing is attached and connected to the dialysis machine. Blood flows out of your body through one needle to the dialysis machine, and then back into your body through another.</p>
<p>The blood that is taken from your body is cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. Dialysis uses a membrane as a filter. Dialysis fluid (also called dialysis solution, or dialysate) controls the balance of fluid, salts, and minerals in your blood. The membrane has tiny holes that the excess fluid and substances in the blood pass through to be taken away in the dialysis fluid.</p>
<p>You need to sit or lie down while you are attached to the machine for treatment.</p>
<p>Having <strong>haemodialysis at home</strong> means you have a kidney dialysis machine in your home and you manage the dialysis process yourself.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-39">39</span>]<span id="reference-39" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Renal failure - home versus hospital haemodialysis: guidance. October 2002. Technical appraisal 48. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/TA48 (accessed on 20 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>Whether you choose to have haemodialysis at home or in a clinic, you&rsquo;ll be given help to learn what it involves and what you need to do. You&rsquo;ll be able to discuss your questions and concerns with your health care team. You won&rsquo;t be expected to do everything yourself at first. Also, you can change your mind about where you have haemodialysis. If you start having haemodialysis in a clinic, you could switch to having it done at home. If you&rsquo;re having haemodialysis at home, but decide you&rsquo;d prefer to have it done in a clinic, that can be arranged.</p>
<p>The first step before starting haemodialysis is to create an easy point of access to your blood vessels, called a vascular access point. This is so blood can flow in and out of your body. It is done before you begin dialysis treatment.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-8">8</span>]<span id="reference-8" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Chronic kidney disease quality standard. November 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qualitystandards/chronickidneydisease/ckdqualitystandard.jsp (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span> This makes dialysis quicker and easier, and reduces the risk of problems.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of vascular access - an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, an AV graft, and a venous catheter.</p>
<p><strong>AV fistulas</strong></p>
<p>A surgeon creates an AV fistula by connecting an artery directly to a vein, usually in your arm. For the surgery, you&rsquo;ll usually be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area where the fistula is being created. Most people don&rsquo;t need to stay in hospital for the operation.</p>
<p>Connecting the artery to the vein causes more blood to flow into the vein. As a result, the vein grows larger and stronger, making it easier for blood to pass in and out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This operation should be done several months before you start dialysis, because it takes time for the vein to grow. A fistula is less likely than other kinds of vascular access to form blood clots or become infected.&nbsp; It should last for many years, and usually longer than any other kind of vascular access.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-9">9</span>]<span id="reference-9" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Vascular access for haemodialysis. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/vascularaccess/index.aspx (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span></p>
<p><strong>AV grafts</strong></p>
<p>If your veins don&rsquo;t develop into an adequate fistula, you can get a tube - called a graft - instead. A graft connects an artery to a vein and is implanted under the skin in your arm. The graft becomes an artificial vein that can be used during haemodialysis. A graft doesn&rsquo;t need to grow in the way a fistula does, so it can be used sooner, often within two or three weeks. Compared with properly formed fistulas, grafts tend to have more problems with clotting and infection and need replacement sooner.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-9">9</span>]<span id="reference-9" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Vascular access for haemodialysis. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/vascularaccess/index.aspx (accessed on 6 June 2012).</span> However, a well-cared-for graft can last several years.</p>
<p><strong>Catheters</strong></p>
<p>If your kidney disease has worsened quickly, you may not have time to get a permanent vascular access before you start haemodialysis. A venous catheter can be used as a temporary access.</p>
<p>A catheter is a soft flexible plastic tube inserted into a vein in your neck, chest, or leg near the groin. It has two channels to allow a two-way flow of blood.</p>
<p>Catheters are not ideal for permanent access. They can clog, become infected, and cause narrowing of the veins in which they are placed. But if you need to start haemodialysis immediately, a catheter will work for several weeks or months while a permanent access develops. Some people are not able to have a permanent AV fistula or graft, and so need to have a catheter inserted permanently. Some people choose to have a permanent catheter to avoid having to use needles, or having an operation to insert a graft.</p>
<p><strong>Other treatments</strong></p>
<p>Whichever type of dialysis you choose, you are likely to need other medical treatments as well. You may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Injections of drugs called erythropoietin to treat anaemia</li>
<li>Phosphate binders</li>

<p>In the UK, between <span class="image-reference">95 in 100</span> and <span class="image-reference">99 in 100</span> people aged 18 to 54 are alive a year after starting dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Castledinea C, Steenkampa R, Feesta T, et al.

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about how different types of dialysis affect length of life:</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether you live longer if you choose haemodialysis or another type of dialysis. In one group of people, those starting on haemodialysis were less likely to live at least three years after starting dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-13">13</span>]<span id="reference-13" class="content-reference">van de Luijtgaarden M, Noordzij M, Stel VS, et al. Effects of comorbid and demographic factors on dialysis modality choice and related patient survival in Europe.

<p>People who have haemodialysis at home seem more likely to live for at least 10 years, compared to people who have haemodialysis in a hospital or clinic. But that could be because people having haemodialysis at home are fitter to start with. It may not be because of where you have treatment.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-19">19</span>]<span id="reference-19" class="content-reference">Mowatt G, Vale L, MacLead A.

<p>Starting dialysis early (when your eGFR is 10 or above) does not seem to make any difference to how long you live.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-20">20</span>]<span id="reference-20" class="content-reference">Cooper BA, Branley P, Bulfone L, et al.

<p>People who are on dialysis are living for longer now than in the past because dialysis techniques are improving all the time. In the past, people on dialysis may only have lived a few years. But now some people have been on dialysis for more than 30 years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-14">14</span>]<span id="reference-14" class="content-reference">Murtagh FEM, Marsh JE, Donohoe P, et al.

<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible for you to work while having dialysis. But it is likely that working during dialysis will mean adjustments for you, your employer, and your family.</p>
<p>Dialysis can make you feel extremely tired, and this may prevent you from working. Employers are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to allow you to work, and this can include providing a suitable room in which to do an exchange.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong> you will need to make time for your dialysis sessions. It may be possible for you to work around home dialysis sessions, as you can time the sessions to suit your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>If you have haemodialysis, you will usually have treatment at least three times a week. But you don't usually need treatment between sessions. You have some time for days out, short holidays, and other activities. If you have dialysis at home you can be more flexible about when you have dialysis.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Many people who are on dialysis feel out of breath and extremely tired. But some people find regular and moderate exercise helps, if they can manage it. Exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming may be suitable for people on dialysis.

<li><strong>Tiredness. </strong>Haemodialysis can make you feel exhausted and short of breath immediately after treatment. However, this can also be caused by anaemia, which is a common problem with established kidney failure. So it&rsquo;s not always easy to tell whether your fatigue is caused by dialysis or not.</li>
<li><strong>Itchy skin and muscle cramps. </strong>The <strong>itchy skin</strong> is thought to be because of a build up of phosphate in your blood. The <strong>muscle cramps</strong> often happen in your lower legs as your muscles adjust to the fluid loss during dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs</strong>. People having haemodialysis sometimes get restless legs. This means that they have a strong urge to move their legs caused by an unpleasant feeling in these limbs. This feeling is worse when they are not active and at night.<span class="content-reference">Kavanagh D, Siddiqui S, Geddes CC. Restless legs syndrome in patients on dialysis.

<li><strong>Low blood pressure. </strong>This can be caused by the sudden drop in fluid levels that happens during dialysis. Low blood pressure can make you feel sick and dizzy during or soon after dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>. People on any type of dialysis may not have the right amounts of minerals like calcium and phosphorus. This can cause pain in the bones and joints, weaker bones, and may make you more likely to have fractures and broken bones.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse.

</ul>
<p><strong>Problems with vascular access points</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, all three types of vascular access points can have problems that need further treatment or surgery.

<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>
<p>People who have haemodialysis can get infections. One of the most common infections is caused by bacteria called <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. In one study, <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Established-kidney-failure-dialysis/90-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">90 people in every 100</a></span>&nbsp;who had haemodialysis got at least one <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection at some stage during dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>These infections can be treated with antibiotics. But if the bacteria get into the blood it can cause a serious condition called sepsis, which can cause death. This is the second most common cause of death, after heart disease, in people having haemodialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>If you have haemodialysis, you will probably need to be attached to a dialysis machine at least three times a week, for four or more hours each time. However, the amount of time varies from person to person. You can&rsquo;t get up and move around while this is happening. If you have&nbsp;haemodialysis at home, you won't need to go to hospital for dialysis sessions.</p>
<p>You will need blood tests and checks, to see whether your treatment is working well enough. These tests and checks may have to be done in hospital or clinic, even if you are having home haemodialysis. The amount of time and the frequency of treatments varies for different people.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>All types of dialysis involve some restrictions to your diet and what you can drink. This can take some adjustment for you and any family members who help prepare your meals. You will be able to speak to a dietitian or other member of your health care team to discuss how best to make changes to your diet.</p>
<p>Most people having haemodialysis need to adjust their diet. The restrictions on your diet and how much fluid you drink can be quite strict.</p>
<p>People on haemodialysis may be encouraged to eat high-quality <strong>protein</strong> from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-37">37</span>]<span id="reference-37" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse. Haemodialysis. December 2011. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/hemodialysis/index.aspx#diet (accessed 18 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>You may need to cut down on foods high in <strong>potassium</strong>, <strong>phosphate</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong>.</p>
<p>You will need to restrict how much fluid you drink. This is needed because your body will gradually make less and less urine once you are having haemodialysis. Excess fluid is taken out during dialysis sessions, but it can build up between sessions, causing puffiness. It can damage your tissues if this happens long-term. So you need to ensure you are not taking in more fluid than you&rsquo;re getting rid of in urine.</p>
<p>Fluid intake is different for each individual. A rough guide for fluid intake is half a litre (just under a pint) of fluid more than the volume of urine that is passed each day. This is usually equivalent to a limit of around a litre of fluid (about one and three quarter pints) a day.</p>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="51_2_further-info_212_0"><p>Kidney dialysis keeps you healthy by filtering your blood, taking on some of the work that your kidneys can no longer do for themselves. Dialysis is a treatment that removes the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.</p>
<p><strong>Peritoneal dialysis</strong></p>
<p>In peritoneal dialysis, instead of using a machine to filter your blood, the internal lining of your abdomen acts as the artificial kidney. This means you don&rsquo;t have to stay in one place while having peritoneal dialysis.</p>
<p>The internal walls of your abdomen are lined with a membrane called the <strong>peritoneum</strong>. This membrane is used for dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid (also called a dialysis solution, or dialysate) is flushed into your abdomen, through a catheter. Waste products from your blood are pulled through the membrane (the peritoneum) into the dialysis fluid, along with excess water. This is drained away, and replaced with clean dialysis fluid.</p>
<p>A cycle of peritoneal dialysis usually needs to be done several times a day, every day. The whole cycle of draining and filling usually takes less than 45 minutes. How long the dialysis fluid is left inside your abdomen varies. It depends on what kind of peritoneal dialysis you have and the kind of treatment you need. But it usually needs to stay in your abdomen for several hours.</p>
<p>Before starting peritoneal dialysis, you need to have a catheter inserted into your abdomen. This is so the dialysis fluid can flow in and out. It&rsquo;s called a Tenckhoff catheter and you&rsquo;ll need an operation to put it in. You might have a general anaesthetic to put you to sleep during the surgery. Or you might have a local anaesthetic to numb the area so you can&rsquo;t feel the catheter being put in. You may have to stay in hospital for a day or two afterwards. The catheter is usually ready to be used after two or three weeks. It remains in place. Some people find this difficult to get used to.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)</strong></p>
<p>If you have this kind of peritoneal dialysis, you do your own dialysis, and can walk and move around with the dialysis solution in your abdomen. You flush 1 to 3 litres of dialysis solution into your abdomen four times a day, every day. You then drain out the dialysis solution after several hours before adding dialysis solution again. This cycle is called an exchange. You can be flexible about how you time the exchanges. Although most people need four exchanges a day, they don&rsquo;t have to be exactly six hours apart, for example. You&rsquo;ll need to attach the new bags and dispose of the old ones for each exchange. Your nurses will teach you how to manage this. You don't need a machine for CAPD. All you need is gravity to fill and empty your abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Other treatments</strong></p>
<p>Whichever type of dialysis you choose, you are likely to need other medical treatments as well. You may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Injections of drugs called erythropoietin to treat anaemia</li>
<li>Phosphate binders</li>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Insulin, if you have diabetes.</li>

<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible for you to work while having dialysis. But it is likely that working during dialysis will mean adjustments for you, your employer, and your family.</p>
<p>Dialysis can make you feel extremely tired, and this may prevent you from working. Employers are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to allow you to work, and this can include giving you time off to attend appointments or providing a suitable room in which to do an exchange.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> and need to do an exchange during the day, your health care team can give advice on how this can best be done in your workplace. A member of your health care team can also answer employers&rsquo; questions about dialysis and, if necessary, visit your place of work to discuss your treatment and offer advice. Having dialysis fluid in your abdomen during peritoneal dialysis can make it difficult to do heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you may be able to go on days out and short holidays, depending on the type of device you have. You will need to take dialysis fluid with you and ensure you have somewhere clean to carry out exchanges.</p>
<p>If you have continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, you may be able to travel for longer, including travelling overseas within the EU. Your health care team may be able to arrange for boxes of dialysis fluid to be delivered to your holiday destination, but some advance notice (one to three months) will be required. You can speak to your health care team to find out if this is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Many people who are on dialysis feel out of breath and extremely tired. But some people find regular and moderate exercise helps, if they can manage it. Exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming may be suitable for people on dialysis. A study of people on dialysis showed that people who exercised up to five times a week lived longer than other people on dialysis.<span class="content-reference">[Stack AG, Molony DA, Rives T, et al.

<ul>
<li><strong>Tiredness. </strong>Peritoneal dialysis can make you feel exhausted and short of breath immediately after treatment. However, this can also be caused by anaemia, which is a common problem with established kidney failure. So it&rsquo;s not always easy to tell whether your fatigue is caused by dialysis or not.</li>
<li><strong>Itchy skin and muscle cramps. </strong>The <strong>itchy skin</strong> is thought to be because of a build up of phosphate in your blood. The <strong>muscle cramps</strong> often happen in your lower legs as your muscles adjust to the fluid loss during dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs</strong>. People having peritoneal dialysis sometimes get restless legs. This means that they have a strong urge to move their legs caused by an unpleasant feeling in these limbs. This feeling is worse when they are not active and at night.<span class="content-reference">Kavanagh D, Siddiqui S, Geddes CC. Restless legs syndrome in patients on dialysis. American Journal of Kidney Diseases. 2004; 43: 763-71.</span></li>
<li><strong>Weight gain.</strong> The dialysis fluid used during&nbsp;peritoneal dialysis contains some sugars that are absorbed into the body and can make you gain weight, particularly if you aren&rsquo;t able to make changes to your diet or exercise regularly. One study found that around <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Established-kidney-failure-dialysis/7-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">7 in 100</a></span> &nbsp;people who have peritoneal dialysis put on 10 kg (1.5 stone) over two years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-89">89</span>]<span id="reference-89" class="content-reference">NHS Choices. Dialysis August 2011. Available at http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Dialysis/Pages/Introduction.aspx (Accessed 13 April 2011)</span></li>
<li><strong>Hernia</strong>. A hernia occurs when an internal part of your body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall. People having&nbsp;peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing a hernia because holding fluid inside the peritoneal cavity for many hours places strain on the muscles of the abdomen. Surgery is usually needed to repair a hernia. A hernia can make some movements difficult and painful, such as bending, coughing, lifting heavy objects, or having sex.</li>
<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>. People on any type of dialysis may not have the right amounts of minerals like calcium and phosphorus. This can cause pain in the bones and joints, weaker bones, and may make you more likely to have fractures and broken bones.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse.

<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>
<p>Some people who have&nbsp;peritoneal dialysisget an infection of the peritoneum, called <strong>peritonitis</strong>.

<p>A much less common type of peritonitis, called encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, can obstruct your bowel, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>People who have peritoneal dialysis can also get <strong>exit site infections. </strong>This is an infection of the area where the catheter comes out through the skin. This causes redness, tenderness, and sometimes pus to collect around the exit site.</p>
<p>Exit site infections can be treated with antibiotics. These are usually given either as tablets or as creams, but sometimes as an injection. There is usually no need to remove the catheter.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an exit site infection spreads down the catheter. This is called a <strong>tunnel infection</strong>. Antibiotics don&rsquo;t always work when someone has a tunnel infection. Instead, people who have a tunnel infection have an operation to remove the catheter.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-93">93</span>]<span id="reference-93" class="content-reference">UK National Kidney Federation.

<p>If you have peritoneal dialysis, you will need to spend one or two days in hospital after an operation to put in a catheter. Most of your dialysis will happen at home (or wherever you are), but you may need time in hospital if you have infections or complications.</p>
<p>If you have continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, you need to carry out the fluid exchange procedure four times a day, every day. It takes about 45 minutes. Apart from that, you can walk around and get on with things.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>All types of dialysis involve some restrictions to your diet and what you can drink. This can take some adjustment for you and any family members who help prepare your meals.

<p>You need to eat high-quality <strong>protein</strong> such as meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, to replace protein lost during dialysis. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p>You may need to limit how much salt you eat. Too much salt can raise your blood pressure to a dangerous level. It also makes you thirsty and can cause puffiness from excess fluid (called oedema).</p>
<p>Eating food with too much <strong>potassium</strong> can be dangerous for people with renal failure. This is because potassium affects how steadily your heart beats. Peritoneal dialysis can help you control your potassium levels. So foods containing potassium are less restricted than if you have other types of dialysis, or they may not even be restricted at all. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Phosphate</strong> builds up in the body in established renal failure and can cause bone problems. It is found in a range of food and drinks, including milk, cheese, liver, and nuts. You may need to restrict the amount of phosphate-containing foods you eat. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p>Your fluid intake may be restricted, so you don&rsquo;t take in more than your body can get rid of in urine and during dialysis. This is usually limited to a litre and a half (about two and a half pints) of fluid a day. But some people have less of a restriction than this, or may not have any restrictions.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-99">99</span>]<span id="reference-99" class="content-reference">Personal communication, Karen Thomsett, April 2012.</span></p>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="51_2_further-info_213_0"><p>Kidney dialysis keeps you healthy by filtering your blood, taking on some of the work that your kidneys can no longer do for themselves. Dialysis is a treatment that removes the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.</p>
<p><strong>Peritoneal dialysis</strong></p>
<p>In peritoneal dialysis, instead of using a machine to filter your blood, the internal lining of your abdomen acts as the artificial kidney. This means you don&rsquo;t have to stay in one place while having peritoneal dialysis.</p>
<p>The internal walls of your abdomen are lined with a membrane called the <strong>peritoneum</strong>. This membrane is used for dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid (also called a dialysis solution, or dialysate) is flushed into your abdomen, through a catheter. Waste products from your blood are pulled through the membrane (the peritoneum) into the dialysis fluid, along with excess water. This is drained away, and replaced with clean dialysis fluid.</p>
<p>A cycle of peritoneal dialysis usually needs to be done several times a day, every day. The whole cycle of draining and filling usually takes less than 45 minutes. How long the dialysis fluid is left inside your abdomen varies. It depends on what kind of peritoneal dialysis you have and the kind of treatment you need. But it usually needs to stay in your abdomen for several hours.</p>
<p>Before starting peritoneal dialysis, you need to have a catheter inserted into your abdomen. This is so the dialysis fluid can flow in and out. It&rsquo;s called a Tenckhoff catheter and you&rsquo;ll need an operation to put it in. You might have a general anaesthetic to put you to sleep during the surgery. Or you might have a local anaesthetic to numb the area so you can&rsquo;t feel the catheter being put in. You may have to stay in hospital for a day or two afterwards. The catheter is usually ready to be used after two or three weeks. It remains in place. Some people find this difficult to get used to.</p>
<p><strong>Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)</strong></p>
<p>This type of peritoneal dialysis uses a machine that performs three to five exchanges during the night, usually while you sleep. The machine automatically adds and then drains the dialysis fluid for you. You have the machine at home. Most people need to spend eight to 10 hours attached to the machine every night. In the morning, you begin one exchange that usually lasts the entire day. After spending the night on the machine, most people keep fluid inside their abdomen during the day, but you will not need to be connected to the dialysis machine during this time.</p>
<p>Some people have help from nurses or other health care professionals to have assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD) at home.</p>
<p><strong>Other treatments</strong></p>
<p>Whichever type of dialysis you choose, you are likely to need other medical treatments as well. You may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Injections of drugs called erythropoietin to treat anaemia</li>
<li>Phosphate binders</li>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Insulin, if you have diabetes.</li>

<p>There is no right or wrong way to have dialysis, and it is usually possible to change from one type of treatment to another. This often happens with peritoneal dialysis, as some people can't stay on this type of dialysis long term. You can discuss this with your care team.</p>
<p>Peritoneal dialysis is also not suitable for everyone. It may be less suitable for people with very little kidney function, or who have other major illnesses. People who have had operations on their abdomen in the past, people with certain bowel conditions such as diverticulitis, or people who are very overweight, may not be able to have peritoneal dialysis.</p>
<p>You need a clean and hygienic place for you to exchange dialysis fluid and set up dialysis machines if you have it at home. You also need space to store dialysis fluid and some equipment to dispose of if after dialysis.</p></div>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether you live longer if you choose peritoneal dialysis rather than other types of dialysis.

<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible for you to work while having dialysis. But it is likely that working during dialysis will mean adjustments for you, your employer, and your family.</p>
<p>Dialysis can make you feel extremely tired, and this may prevent you from working. Employers are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to allow you to work, and this can include giving you time off to attend appointments or providing a suitable room in which to do an exchange.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> and need to do an exchange during the day, your health care team can give advice on how this can best be done in your workplace. A member of your health care team can also answer employers&rsquo; questions about dialysis and, if necessary, visit your place of work to discuss your treatment and offer advice. Having dialysis fluid in your abdomen during peritoneal dialysis can make it difficult to do heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you may be able to go on days out and short holidays, depending on the type of device you have. You will need to take dialysis fluid with you and ensure you have somewhere clean to carry out exchanges.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>automated peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you need to be attached to a dialysis machine at night. This makes it harder to travel.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Many people who are on dialysis feel out of breath and extremely tired. But some people find regular and moderate exercise helps, if they can manage it. Exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming may be suitable for people on dialysis.

<li><strong>Tiredness. </strong>All types of dialysis can make you feel exhausted and short of breath immediately after treatment.

<li><strong>Itchy skin and muscle cramps. </strong>The <strong>itchy skin</strong> is thought to be because of a build up of phosphate in your blood. The <strong>muscle cramps</strong> often happen in your lower legs as your muscles adjust to the fluid loss during dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs</strong>. People having peritoneal dialysis sometimes get restless legs. This means that they have a strong urge to move their legs caused by an unpleasant feeling in these limbs. This feeling is worse when they are not active and at night.<span class="content-reference">Kavanagh D, Siddiqui S, Geddes CC. Restless legs syndrome in patients on dialysis.

<li><strong>Weight gain.</strong> The dialysis fluid used during&nbsp;peritoneal dialysis contains some sugars that are absorbed into the body and can make you gain weight, particularly if you aren&rsquo;t able to make changes to your diet or exercise regularly. One study found that around <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Established-kidney-failure-dialysis/7-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">7 in 100</a></span>&nbsp;people who have peritoneal dialysis put on 10 kg (1.5 stone) over two years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-89">89</span>]<span id="reference-89" class="content-reference">NHS Choices.

<li><strong>Hernia</strong>. A hernia occurs when an internal part of your body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall. People having&nbsp;peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing a hernia because holding fluid inside the peritoneal cavity for many hours places strain on the muscles of the abdomen. Surgery is usually needed to repair a hernia. A hernia can make some movements difficult and painful, such as bending, coughing, lifting heavy objects, or having sex.</li>
<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>. People on any type of dialysis may not have the right amounts of minerals like calcium and phosphorus. This can cause pain in the bones and joints, weaker bones, and may make you more likely to have fractures and broken bones.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse.

<p>A much less common type of peritonitis, called encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, can obstruct your bowel, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>People who have peritoneal dialysis can also get <strong>exit site infections. </strong>This is an infection of the area where the catheter comes out through the skin. This causes redness, tenderness, and sometimes pus to collect around the exit site.</p>
<p>Exit site infections can be treated with antibiotics. These are usually given either as tablets or as creams, but sometimes as an injection. There is usually no need to remove the catheter.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an exit site infection spreads down the catheter. This is called a <strong>tunnel infection</strong>. Antibiotics don&rsquo;t always work when someone has a tunnel infection. Instead, people who have a tunnel infection have an operation to remove the catheter.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-93">93</span>]<span id="reference-93" class="content-reference">UK National Kidney Federation.

<p>If you have peritoneal dialysis, you will need to spend one or two days in hospital after an operation to put in a catheter. Most of your dialysis will happen at home (or wherever you are), but you may need time in hospital if you have infections or complications.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>All types of dialysis involve some restrictions to your diet and what you can drink. This can take some adjustment for you and any family members who help prepare your meals. You will be able to speak to a dietitian or other member of your health care team to discuss how best to make changes to your diet.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-98">98</span>]<span id="reference-98" class="content-reference">National Institutes of Health. Treatment methods for kidney failure: peritoneal dialysis. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/peritoneal/index.aspx (accessed on 18 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>You need to eat high-quality <strong>protein</strong> such as meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, to replace protein lost during dialysis. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p>You need to limit how much salt you eat. Too much salt can raise your blood pressure to a dangerous level. It also makes you thirsty and can cause puffiness from excess fluid (called oedema).</p>
<p>Eating food with too much <strong>potassium</strong> can be dangerous for people with renal failure. This is because potassium affects how steadily your heart beats. Peritoneal dialysis can help you control your potassium levels. So foods containing potassium are less restricted than if you have other types of dialysis, or they may not even be restricted at all. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Phosphate</strong> builds up in the body in established renal failure and can cause bone problems. It is found in a range of food and drinks, including milk, cheese, liver, and nuts. You may need to restrict the amount of phosphate-containing foods you eat. Your dietitian can give you advice on what foods are best for you to eat.</p>
<p>Your fluid intake may be restricted, so you don&rsquo;t take in more than your body can get rid of in urine and during dialysis. This is usually limited to a litre and a half (about two and a half pints) of fluid a day. But some people have less of a restriction than this, or may not have any restrictions.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-99">99</span>]<span id="reference-99" class="content-reference">Personal communication, Karen Thomsett, April 2012.</span></p></div>
