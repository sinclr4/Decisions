<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

                <div data-cms-content-id="59_1_further-info_228"><p>The kidneys are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are just below your ribcage, one on either side of your spine, at the back of the body. Every day the kidneys filter about 200 litres of fluid, removing 2 to 3 litres (more than 3 to 5 pints) of water and waste products from the blood. If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body.</p>
<p>Blood is moved through the kidneys in blood vessels. Tiny filters within the kidneys act like a sieve. They keep proteins and cells in the blood where they are needed. Extra fluid and waste is passed to the bladder in urine. The bladder stores urine until you go to the toilet. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is needed to make red blood cells. Healthy kidneys help keep your blood pressure stable. And kidneys are important for absorbing the right amount of calcium and phosphate, which helps keep your bones strong.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="59_1_further-info_229"><p>Chronic kidney disease means your kidneys are gradually losing their ability to filter waste products out of your blood.</p>
<p>You may also hear it called&nbsp;<strong>chronic renal failure</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>chronic kidney failure</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>chronic renal insufficiency</strong>. Chronic means it&rsquo;s a long-term condition, and renal means it involves your kidneys.</p>
<p>Doctors use the term&nbsp;<strong>kidney function</strong>&nbsp;as a way to describe how well your kidneys filter blood. Kidney function can be measured with a blood test. Young people with two healthy kidneys usually have around 90 percent to 100 percent of their kidney function. Your kidney function tends to get lower with age. This isn&rsquo;t usually a problem, unless it keeps on getting lower.</p>
<p>People can lose some of their kidney function without it causing any problems or symptoms. But health problems begin when the kidneys can no longer do all their jobs well enough. When this happens varies from person to person. Some people might get symptoms when they still have quite a lot of kidney function, while others don&rsquo;t get symptoms even though they have lost more kidney function.</p></div>

If your blood tests show kidney function of 15 percent or less, this is called chronic kidney disease stage 5, also known as established kidney failure. You may also hear it called end stage kidney failure.</p>
<p>If you have established kidney failure, you may get symptoms because of waste building up in your blood. But this doesn&rsquo;t happen to everyone. You may not get symptoms until your kidney function is much lower than 15 percent.</p></div>

<p>Serum creatinine measures a chemical in the blood. It is used to calculate what is called the estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR for short). The eGFR calculation is a calculation of how much blood your kidneys are able to filter in one minute. This number is about the same as your kidney function. So if you have 100 percent kidney function, your eGFR is also likely to be 100.</p>
<p>Your eGFR is used by doctors to put your kidney disease into &lsquo;stages&rsquo;.&nbsp; There are five stages of kidney disease. If you have completely normal kidney function, you have an eGFR of 90 or over. If you have an eGFR between 15 and 90, you have some kidney damage (stages 1 to 4).</p>
<p>If your eGFR is less than 15, you have chronic kidney disease stage 5, which is established kidney failure.</p></div>

This can allow you to live your life much as you did before your kidneys stopped working. The donor can be someone who is living or someone who has just died (a deceased donor). Here, we talk about kidneys from living donors.</p>
<p>A living donor is someone who gives one of their two kidneys to a person whose kidneys aren&rsquo;t working. Usually, the living donor is a family member or friend of the person who receives the kidney. However, sometimes a donor will offer a kidney to someone they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although most people receive kidneys from deceased donors, living kidney donation is becoming more common. More than 1 in 3 kidney transplants in the UK now involve a kidney from a living donor.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Statistics and Clinical Audit, NHS Blood and Transplant.

<ul>
<li><strong>You may spend little or no time waiting for a kidney</strong>. Once a suitable living donor is found, the transplant can take place at any time that is convenient for you, your donor, and your transplant team. This may mean you can receive a transplant before you start dialysis, which can improve the chances of transplant success.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-11">11</span>]<span id="reference-11" class="content-reference">UK Renal Association.

<li><strong>Your chance of a lasting transplant is better</strong>. Kidneys from living donors tend to last longer than those from deceased donors. This is true even if the living donor&rsquo;s kidney isn&rsquo;t a very good match.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The transplant process</strong></p>
<p>The transplant process usually begins when you find out that your kidneys are failing and you are considering your treatment options. If you&rsquo;d like to be considered for a transplant, you&rsquo;ll be evaluated to see whether you are healthy enough for this operation and there&rsquo;s a good chance that the transplant will succeed. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-13">13</span>]<span id="reference-13" class="content-reference">National Kidney Foundation. Can everyone on dialysis have a kidney transplant? February 2011. Available at http://www.kidney.org.uk/Medical-Info/transplant/txhave.html (accessed on13 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are a candidate for a transplant, the next step is finding a kidney that&rsquo;s a suitable match. This is based on whether the kidney is compatible with your blood and tissue type. You&rsquo;ll have tests looking at your blood group and genetic markers called HLA factors (HLA is short for human leucocyte antigen). Kidneys that are a closer match tend to last longer.</p>
<p>If you have family members or friends who are interested in donating a kidney to you, their blood group and tissue type will also be checked, as well as their health and medical history. This is to make sure that donating a kidney won&rsquo;t put their health at risk. It also aims to make sure the potential donor doesn&rsquo;t have an infection or cancer that could be passed on to you through the transplant. No kidney transplant is without risk. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-8">8</span>]<span id="reference-8" class="content-reference">British Transplant Society.UKguidelines for living donor kidney transplant. May 2011. Available at http://www.bts.org.uk/transplantation/standards-and-guidelines (accessed on31 May 2012).</span></p>
<p>If a living donor&rsquo;s blood group or tissue type isn&rsquo;t a good match, it may still be possible to receive their kidney. You may have treatment to &lsquo;desensitise&rsquo; your immune system before the transplant, so that it won&rsquo;t attack the kidney. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">The British Transplantation Society. Guidelines for antibody incompatible transplantation. January 2011. Available at http://www.bts.org.uk/transplantation/standards-and-guidelines (accessed13 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>You may also be able to find a suitable living donor through the paired donation matching scheme. This matches people who need kidneys with living donors who are unable to donate to their intended recipient. For example, let&rsquo;s say your spouse is willing to provide you with a kidney but it is not a suitable match. The scheme would attempt to match you and your spouse with another donor-recipient pair. The matching pairs would then &lsquo;swap&rsquo; kidneys, leading to two transplants.

<p><strong>The operation</strong></p>
<p>You and your donor will be operated on at the same time or in quick succession. Often, one team of surgeons will remove the kidney from the donor, while another prepares the recipient for the transplant. This means the kidney is transplanted quickly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a general anaesthetic, so you will be asleep during the operation. The surgeon will make a cut in one side of your lower abdomen and insert the new kidney. This cut is usually around 15 to 20 centimetres long. The kidney&rsquo;s main blood vessels will be attached to those in your groin, and its ureter will be connected to your bladder (the ureter is the tube that drains urine from your kidney). Your damaged kidneys will probably be left in place.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-17">17</span>]<span id="reference-17" class="content-reference">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NKUDIC). Treatment methods for kidney failure: transplantation. September 2010. Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/transplant/index.aspx (accessed on13 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>Before or immediately after surgery, you will begin taking immunosuppressive (anti-rejection) medicines. These drugs suppress your immune system, making it less likely to attack the new kidney, causing your body to reject it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most kidneys from living donors (about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/95-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">95 in 100</a>)&nbsp;start making urine straight away, although occasionally this takes days, weeks or months.&nbsp;If the kidney doesn&rsquo;t start making urine straight away, you&rsquo;ll have dialysis until your kidney is working.</p>
<p>You will be closely monitored after your transplant. You will probably stay at hospital for one to two weeks, although some hospitals discharge patients as early as four or five days after surgery.</p>

Some vaccines are not safe for people who are taking drugs that suppress their immune system.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-24">24</span>]<span id="reference-24" class="content-reference">National Kidney Federation. Holiday/travel vaccinations. February 2011. Available at http://www.kidney.org.uk/Medical-Info/drugs/vacc2.html (accessed on13 April 2012).</span> And when you&rsquo;re abroad, you&rsquo;ll need to take common sense steps to avoid infection, such as drinking bottled water in areas where the tap water may not be safe to drink.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>You can get back to your exercise routine after you&rsquo;ve recovered from your transplant surgery. You should avoid activities that may put your kidney at risk of injury (such as playing rugby and other contact sports). That&rsquo;s because a transplanted kidney sits in your lower abdomen, where it is less protected than your original kidneys (which are nestled below your ribcage).</p></div>

<p><strong>Problems from the surgery and transplanted kidney</strong></p>
<p>A kidney transplant carries a risk of bleeding, infection, and reactions to the general anaesthetic, which can be serious.</p>
<p>After your surgery, you may get blood or urine leaking around your new kidney. If urine is leaking or blocked, you may need another operation. If a blood vessel leaks, you may need a blood transfusion and surgery to correct it. A blocked blood vessel is more serious. If the new kidney does not get enough blood, it may need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blood vessel may also become narrowed (this is called arterial stenosis). This can happen months or even years after your transplant, causing a rapid and potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure. You will probably need surgery to widen the blood vessel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a risk of dying from a kidney transplant, either from the surgery or from problems that arise soon after.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for treating acute rejection episodes in kidney transplant recipients. In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley,Chichester,UK.</span> This is usually treatable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance you may get an infection or cancer from a donated kidney. All kidneys and their donors are carefully screened to help prevent these problems, but no kidney is without risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problems from immunosuppressive medicines</strong></p>
<p>For a kidney transplant to last, you must take medicines long-term to prevent your body from rejecting the kidney. These are called immunosuppressive drugs. They &lsquo;suppress&rsquo; your immune system so it won&rsquo;t recognise the kidney as foreign and attack it.</p>
<p>There are many different types of immunosuppressive drugs, and most people take a combination of these. These drugs can cause a variety of side effects, including stomach irritation, hair growth or thinning, shaking of the hands (tremors), swollen gums, changes in appearance (for example, your face may become fuller), weight gain or loss, and spots (acne).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">British National Formulary. Drugs affecting the immune response. Section 8.2. British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Also available at http://bnf.org (accessed on 7 June 2012).</span> Many of these problems may go away after you&rsquo;ve been taking the medicines for a while. Some of the drugs may also raise your risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and weak bones (osteoporosis).</p>
<p>The most serious side effects of these medicines are an increased risk of infections and cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infections</strong>: By suppressing your immune system, these drugs weaken your body&rsquo;s resistance to infections. This means you&rsquo;re more likely to become ill when you come in contact with viruses and other germs. And when you do get an infection, it may last longer than usual. Many people get infections of the urinary tract. If you get these frequently, this can damage your kidney. Your doctor may prescribe a regular low-dose antibiotic to prevent this. You are also more likely to become ill from infections that don&rsquo;t usually cause problems in people with fully functioning immune systems. These include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus. People who&rsquo;ve had a kidney transplant are usually advised to get vaccinated against the flu, pneumonia, and meningitis.</li>
<li><strong>Cancer</strong>: Immunosuppressive drugs increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Up to <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/20-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a></span> people will develop cancer within 10 years of having a kidney transplant.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">Lutz J, Heemann U. Tumours after kidney transplantation. Current Opinion in Urology. 2003; 13: 105-109.</span> Skin cancer is the most common type, followed by cancer of the immune system (lymphoma). To minimise your risk of skin cancer, it&rsquo;s important not to spend too much time in the sun (for example, sun-bathing) and to wear sunscreen or protective clothing. Most people who develop skin cancer can be successfully treated with surgery to remove the cancer.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Winkelhorst JT, Brokelman WJ, Tiggeler RG, Wobbes T.

<p><strong>Risks for a living donor </strong></p>
<p>Most people have no lasting problems from donating a kidney, as their remaining kidney can do the work of two. Kidney donors also typically live as long as non-donors and are no more likely to develop kidney failure, despite having only one kidney.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-32">32</span>]<span id="reference-32" class="content-reference">Ibrahim HN, Foley R, Tan L, et al.

<p>You will probably stay in hospital one to two weeks after your transplant, until your new kidney is working and stable.

<p>You will continue to have up to three regular appointments a week after your transplant. This will then drop to one appointment a week, and continue to become less frequent.

This can allow you to live your life much as you did before your kidneys stopped working. The donor can be someone who is living (often a family member or a friend) or someone who has just died (called a deceased donor). Here, we talk about kidneys from deceased donors.</p>
<p>Most deceased donors are people who have had a sudden and irreversible brain injury, usually due to a blood vessel bursting in their brain, a stroke, or an accident.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-41">41</span>]<span id="reference-41" class="content-reference">NHS Blood and Transplant. Organ and tissue donation - your questions answered. Available at http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/questions/questions.asp (accessed on 31 May 2012).</span> There are two types of deceased donors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donors after brain death </strong>are donors whose heart is still pumping blood. A series of tests is performed to determine whether brain death has occurred. This means they have no brain activity and cannot breathe on their own. Once their family members have given their permission for donation, the donor&rsquo;s kidneys are retrieved while their heart is still beating. These donors are often called <strong>donation after brain stem death (DBD) donors</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Donors after circulatory death </strong>are donors whose heart has stopped beating and can&rsquo;t be restarted. Their organs are retrieved after their heart has stopped working, once their family members have given their consent. These donors are often called <strong>donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chances of a successful transplant are similar for kidneys from both types of deceased donors.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-42">42</span>]<span id="reference-42" class="content-reference">Statistics and Clinical Audit, NHS Blood and Transplant.

<p><strong>The transplant process</strong></p>
<p>The transplant process usually begins when you find out that your kidneys are failing and you are considering your treatment options. If you&rsquo;d like to be considered for a kidney from a deceased donor, you&rsquo;ll be evaluated to see whether you are healthy enough for the transplant operation and there&rsquo;s a good chance that the transplant will succeed.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-43">43</span>]<span id="reference-43" class="content-reference">National Kidney Foundation. Can everyone on dialysis have a kidney transplant? February 2011. Available at http://www.kidney.org.uk/Medical-Info/transplant/txhave.html (accessed on 13 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>If you are a candidate for a transplant, you&rsquo;ll be added to a national waiting list to find a suitable kidney from a deceased donor. You&rsquo;ll have tests to check your blood group as well as your tissue type, which involves looking at genetic markers called HLA factors (HLA is short for human leukocyte antigen). Kidneys that are a closer match tend to last longer.</p>
<p>You can be placed on the waiting list for a kidney within six months of when you&rsquo;re expected to need dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-44">44</span>]<span id="reference-44" class="content-reference">UK Renal Association. Clinical practice guidelines. Module 4: assessment for renal transplantation. 2008. Available at http://www.renal.org (accessed on 7 June 2012).</span> Most people go on dialysis while waiting for a kidney.</p>
<p>Deceased donors and their kidneys are carefully screened to improve the chances that the kidney transplant will last and won't pass on an illness. No kidney is without risk, however. You need to think about whether you&rsquo;d accept a kidney that isn&rsquo;t a very good match or comes from a less-than-ideal donor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some questions to consider. Your transplant team will help you weigh the pros and cons of each:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you accept a kidney from a donor after circulatory death?</li>
<li>Would you accept a kidney from an older donor?</li>
<li>Would you accept a kidney that isn&rsquo;t a very good match?</li>
<li>Would you accept a kidney that may pose a higher risk of giving you cancer or an infection?</li>
<li>Would you accept a kidney that has been out of the donor&rsquo;s body for a while? Ideally kidneys from donors after brain death should be transplanted within 18 hours, and kidneys from donors after circulatory death should be transplanted even sooner.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-45">45</span>]<span id="reference-45" class="content-reference">NHS Blood and Transplant, British Transplantation Society. Guidelines for consent for solid organ transplantation in adults. March 2011. Available at http://www.bts.org.uk/transplantation/standards-and-guidelines/ (accessed on 13 April 2012).</span> But this isn&rsquo;t always possible. Some kidneys can be outside the body for 36 to 48 hours and still be suitable for transplant, but the longer a kidney is stored, the greater the risk of problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-46">46</span>]<span id="reference-46" class="content-reference">U.S. Government Information on Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation. Organ matching process. Available at&nbsp; http://www.organdonor.gov/about/organmatching.html (accessed on 7 June 2012).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>When a suitable kidney is available, you must get to your transplant unit promptly. You&rsquo;ll have further tests to check whether you are fit enough for the operation. You&rsquo;ll also have tests to check whether your immune system makes substances (HLA antigens) that specifically attack the donor&rsquo;s kidney. If not, you should be able to receive the kidney.</p>
<p>You might also be called in as a back-up (called &lsquo;first reserve&rsquo;) should the person matched with the kidney not be able to use the organ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The operation</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a general anaesthetic, so you will be asleep during the operation. The surgeon will make a cut in one side of your lower abdomen and insert the new kidney. This cut is usually around 15 to 20 centimetres long. The kidney&rsquo;s main blood vessels will be attached to those in your groin, and its ureter will be connected to your bladder (the ureter is the tube that drains urine from your kidney). Your damaged kidneys will probably be left in place.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-47">47</span>]<span id="reference-47" class="content-reference">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Available at http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/KUDiseases/pubs/transplant/index.aspx (accessed on 13 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>Before or immediately after surgery, you will begin taking immunosuppressive (anti-rejection) medicines. These drugs suppress your immune system, making it less likely to attack the new kidney and your body to reject it.</p>
<p>Many kidneys from deceased donors start making urine straight away &ndash; about <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/50-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">50 in 100</a></span> kidneys from circulatory death donors, and <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/70-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">70 in 100</a></span> kidneys from brain death donors, start working straight after the transplant. However, sometimes this takes days, weeks or months. You&rsquo;ll have dialysis until your kidney is working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be closely monitored after your transplant. You will probably stay at hospital for one to two weeks, although some hospitals discharge patients as early as four or five days after surgery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may be more prone to getting infections after a transplant, because of the drugs you&rsquo;re taking to suppress your immune system. So you might want to take extra care not to expose yourself to these illnesses, particularly within the first few months of your transplant.</p>
<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>You should be able to return to your work when you are recovered from your operation.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>Provided you are in good health, you should be able to travel abroad after a kidney transplant. Doctors often recommend not travelling abroad within the first year of your transplant. If you are travelling to a country where travel vaccinations are recommended, you&rsquo;ll need to check with your doctor before getting these. Some vaccines are not safe for people who are taking drugs that suppress their immune system.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-59">59</span>]<span id="reference-59" class="content-reference">National Kidney Federation.

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>You can get back to your exercise routine after you&rsquo;ve recovered from your transplant surgery. You should avoid activities that may put your kidney at risk of injury (such as playing rugby and other contact sports). That&rsquo;s because a transplanted kidney sits in your lower abdomen, where it is less protected than your original kidneys (which are nestled below your ribcage).</p></div>

<p><strong>Problems from the surgery and transplanted kidney</strong></p>
<p>A kidney transplant carries a risk of bleeding, infection, and reactions to the general anaesthetic, which can be serious.</p>
<p>After your surgery, you may get blood or urine leaking around your new kidney. If urine is leaking or blocked, you may need another operation. If a blood vessel leaks, you may need a blood transfusion and surgery to correct it. A blocked blood vessel is more serious. If the new kidney does not get enough blood, it may need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blood vessel may also become narrowed (this is called arterial stenosis). This can happen months or even years after your transplant, causing a rapid and potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure. You will probably need surgery to widen the blood vessel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a risk of dying from a kidney transplant, either from the surgery or from problems that arise soon after.

<p>If your transplant fails, you can go on dialysis and also be considered for another kidney transplant. Or you might decide you want conservative care.</p>
<p>Within a year of having a kidney transplant, between <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/15-in-100-and-35-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">15 in 100 and 35 in 100</a></span>&nbsp;people will have an episode where their body tries to reject their kidney.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-63">63</span>]<span id="reference-63" class="content-reference">Webster AC, Pankhurst T, Rinaldi F, et al. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for treating acute rejection episodes in kidney transplant recipients. In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span> This is usually treatable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance you may get an infection or cancer from a donated kidney. All kidneys and their donors are carefully screened to help prevent these problems, but no kidney is without risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problems from immunosuppressive medicines</strong></p>
<p>For a kidney transplant to last, you must take medicines long-term to prevent your body from rejecting the kidney. These are called immunosuppressive drugs. They &lsquo;suppress&rsquo; your immune system so it won&rsquo;t recognise the kidney as foreign and attack it.</p>
<p>There are many different types of immunosuppressive drugs, and most people take a combination of these. These drugs can cause a variety of side effects, including stomach irritation, hair growth or thinning, shaking of the hands (tremors), swollen gums, changes in appearance (for example, your face may become fuller), weight gain or loss, and spots (acne).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">British National Formulary. Drugs affecting the immune response. Section 8.2. British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Also available at http://bnf.org (accessed on 7 June 2012).</span> Many of these problems may go away after you&rsquo;ve been taking the medicines for a while. Some of the drugs may also raise your risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and weak bones (osteoporosis).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most serious side effects of these medicines are an increased risk of infections and cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infections</strong>: By suppressing your immune system, these drugs weaken your body&rsquo;s resistance to infections. This means you&rsquo;re more likely to become ill when you come in contact with viruses and other germs. And when you do get an infection, it may last longer than usual. Many people get infections of the urinary tract. If you get these frequently, this can damage your kidney. Your doctor may prescribe a regular low-dose antibiotic to prevent this. You are also more likely to become ill from infections that don&rsquo;t usually cause problems in people with fully functioning immune systems. These include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus. People who&rsquo;ve had a kidney transplant are usually advised to get vaccinated against the flu, pneumonia, and meningitis.</li>
<li><strong>Cancer</strong>: Immunosuppressive drugs increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Up to <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure-transplant/20-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a></span> people will develop cancer within 10 years of having a kidney transplant.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">Lutz J, Heemann U. Tumours after kidney transplantation. Current Opinion in Urology. 2003; 13: 105-109.</span> Skin cancer is the most common type , followed by cancer of the immune system (lymphoma). To minimise your risk of skin cancer, it&rsquo;s important not to spend too much time in the sun (for example, sun-bathing) and to wear sunscreen or protective clothing. Most people who develop skin cancer can be successfully treated with surgery to remove the cancer.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Winkelhorst JT, Brokelman WJ, Tiggeler RG, Wobbes T.

<p>You will probably stay in hospital one to two weeks after your transplant, until your new kidney is working and stable.

<p>You will continue to have up to three regular appointments a week after your transplant. This will then drop to one appointment a week, and continue to become less frequent.

<p>You will need to take drugs to suppress your immune system for as long as your new kidney is working. For many people, this is the rest of their life. You will also have regular appointments to check on your kidney and your health.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Usually there are no diet and fluid restrictions after a kidney transplant. However, some people do need to modify what they eat, because of other health problems (such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol) or their immunosuppressive drugs.</p>
