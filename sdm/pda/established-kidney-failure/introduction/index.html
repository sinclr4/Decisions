It doesn&rsquo;t filter extra fluid and waste products out of your blood. The aim of conservative care is to make you comfortable and relieve your symptoms, not to extend your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conservative care is sometimes called non-dialysis care, non-dialytic care, supportive care, or conservative management. If you have conservative care, you don&rsquo;t have kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant. Instead, you have treatments to manage your symptoms. These are treatments you are probably already taking. Even if you decide to have dialysis or a transplant, you may continue to take some of these treatments as well.</p>
<p>Which treatments you take depends on what symptoms you have. They can include:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Jassal SV, Kelman EE, Watson D. Non-dialysis care: an important component of care for elderly individuals with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. Nephron Clinical Practice. 2011; 119 (supplement 1): S5-S9.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Drugs to help with anaemia. Anaemia can make you tired and weak because your blood doesn&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body well enough. You may have an injection of drugs called erythropoietin-stimulating agents (EPO), which help your body to make red blood cells, and have a drip containing iron.</li>
<li>Pain relief medicine.</li>
<li>Drugs to relieve itching.</li>
<li>Drugs called diuretics to reduce puffiness and swelling from excess fluid.</li>
<li>Drugs to help with feeling sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also take medicines to prevent and manage other problems, such as heart disease, bone disease, and high levels of phosphate in your blood.</p>
<p>You will be looked after by a team of health care professionals. The people involved may vary from one hospital to another. The team may include kidney nurses, district nurses, your GP, a dietitian, and a renal physician (kidney doctor). Older people may be looked after by a specialist in elderly care.</p>
<p>If you are relatively well, you may have appointments for treatment in hospital or a clinic. If you are very unwell and you have difficulty getting around, you may be able to have treatment in your home, or in a nursing home or hospice.</p></div>

<p>Ideally, you would start thinking about whether you want conservative care or dialysis several months before you start on either treatment. You can start on conservative care at any time. Dialysis takes more preparation time, so it helps to have thought about it in advance.</p>
<p>Many people who choose conservative care are elderly and have other serious illnesses beside kidney disease.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Sarbjit V, Jassal EE, Watson KD. Non-Dialysis Care: An important component of care for elderly individuals with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. Nephron Clinical Practice. 2011; 119 (supplement 1): S5-S9.</span>&nbsp;For example, some people have cancer, heart failure, or dementia, as well as kidney disease. They or their carers may decide that the benefit of having dialysis is outweighed by the side effects and the amount of time they need to spend on dialysis.</p>
<p>Some people choose conservative care because they are frail and near the end of their lives. They may feel that the preparation work for dialysis is likely to take too long or be too disruptive to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>If you decide to try conservative care first, you can change your mind later. For example, if your circumstances change or you start to get more symptoms, you can talk to your doctor about starting dialysis. However, it can take months to prepare for dialysis, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to be clear about your choices at the start. People who delay the start of dialysis treatment sometimes need to start dialysis as an emergency. This can lead to complications and less effective treatment.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-3">3</span>]<span id="reference-3" class="content-reference">Thilly N, Boini S, Soudant M, et al.

<p><strong>Restrictions on diet and fluid </strong></p>
<p>When you start conservative care, your dietitian may suggest a diet that controls salt and potassium, to protect the amount of renal function you have left. But as time goes on, especially if you have a poor appetite and are losing weight, you may be able to eat whatever you want.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Sarbjit V, Jassal EE, Watson KD.

<p>Whether you need to restrict the amount of fluid you drink will depend on your symptoms. If excess fluid is causing swelling or puffiness, you may need to cut down on salt and fluid as much as is comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>End of life</strong></p>
<p>As you approach the end of your life, you may like to consider choices you have concerning death, such as where you&rsquo;d prefer to be cared for when you die.

Dialysis is a treatment that removes the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two main types of dialysis treatment - <strong>haemodialysis</strong> and <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Haemodialysis</strong></p>
<p>During haemodialysis, a machine takes unfiltered blood from your body and removes the waste, before the blood is transferred back into your body. You usually need haemodialysis at least three times a week, for at least four hours each session. However, the amount of time varies from person to person.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-17">17</span>]<span id="reference-17" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and&nbsp;Clinical Excellence. Chronic kidney disease quality standard. November 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qualitystandards/chronickidneydisease/ckdqualitystandard.jsp (accessed&nbsp;on 20 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>Haemodialysis can either be done in hospital, in a dialysis centre, or in your own home.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-18">18</span>]<span id="reference-18" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Renal failure - home versus hospital haemodialysis: guidance. October 2002. Technical appraisal 48. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/TA48 (accessed on 20 April 2012).</span>&nbsp;You need to sit or lie down while you are attached to the machine for treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow blood to flow in and out of your body, you need an easy point of access to your blood vessels, called a vascular access point. You may have an operation to create an access point from your own blood vessels (called an AV fistula) or surgery to implant a piece of tube under your skin (called an AV graft).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-17">17</span>]<span id="reference-17" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and&nbsp;Clinical Excellence. Chronic kidney disease quality standard. November 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qualitystandards/chronickidneydisease/ckdqualitystandard.jsp (accessed&nbsp;on 20 April 2012).</span></p>
<p>These are both permanent access points, which make dialysis quicker and easier, and reduce the risk of problems. However, if your kidney disease worsens quickly, you may not have time to get a permanent access point before you start haemodialysis. In this case, a catheter can be used for a temporary access while a permanent access is created. A catheter is a soft flexible plastic tube inserted into a vein. Some people have a catheter inserted permanently.</p>
<p><strong>Peritoneal dialysis</strong></p>
<p>In peritoneal dialysis, instead of using a machine to filter your blood, the internal lining of your abdomen acts as the artificial kidney. This means you don&rsquo;t have to stay in one place while having peritoneal dialysis.</p>
<p>The internal walls of your abdomen are lined with a membrane called the <strong>peritoneum</strong>. This membrane is used for dialysis. In peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid (also called a dialysis solution, or dialysate) is flushed into your abdomen, through a catheter. Waste products from your blood are pulled through the membrane (the peritoneum) into the dialysis fluid, along with excess water. This is drained away, and replaced with clean dialysis fluid.</p>
<p>A cycle of peritoneal dialysis usually needs to be done several times a day, every day. The whole cycle of draining and filling usually takes less than 45 minutes. How long the dialysis fluid is left inside your abdomen varies. But it usually needs to stay in your abdomen for several hours.</p>
<p>Before starting peritoneal dialysis, you need to have a catheter inserted into your abdomen. This is so the dialysis fluid can flow in and out. It&rsquo;s called a Tenckhoff catheter and you&rsquo;ll need an operation to put it in. The catheter remains in place. Some people find this difficult to get used to.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to have peritoneal dialysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis</strong> (<strong>CAPD</strong>): You flush 1 to 3 litres of dialysis solution into your abdomen four times a day, every day. You drain out the dialysis solution after several hours before adding dialysis solution again. This cycle is called an exchange. You can walk and move around with the dialysis solution in your abdomen.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated peritoneal dialysis</strong> (<strong>APD</strong>): This type of dialysis uses a machine that performs three to five exchanges during the night, usually while you sleep. You have the machine at home. Most people need to spend eight to 10 hours attached to the machine every night. In the morning, you begin one exchange that usually lasts the entire day.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other treatments</strong></p>
<p>Whichever type of dialysis you choose, you are likely to need other medical treatments as well. You may need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamins</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Injections of drugs called erythropoietin to treat anaemia</li>
<li>Phosphate binders</li>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Insulin, if you have diabetes.</li>

<p><strong>Work life</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible for you to work while having dialysis. But it is likely that working during dialysis will mean adjustments for you, your employer, and your family.</p>
<p>Dialysis can make you feel extremely tired, and this may prevent you from working. Employers are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to allow you to work, and this can include giving you time off to attend appointments or providing a suitable room in which to do an exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Social life and travel</strong></p>
<p>You can travel while having dialysis. The length of your travels will depend on your type of dialysis.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, you will usually have treatment at least three times a week. But you don't usually need treatment between sessions, enabling you to schedule outings. You should have time for days out, short holidays, and other activities.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you may be able to travel for longer, including travelling overseas within the EU. Your health care team may be able to arrange for boxes of dialysis fluid to be delivered to your holiday destination, but some advance notice (one to three months) will be required. You can speak to your health care team to find out if this is possible.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>automated peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you need to be attached to a dialysis machine at night. This makes it harder to travel.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Many people who are on dialysis feel out of breath and extremely tired. But some people find regular and moderate exercise helps, if they can manage it. Exercises such as walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming may be suitable for people on dialysis. A study of people on dialysis showed that people who exercised up to five times a week lived longer than other people on dialysis.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="14_2_further-info_65_6"><p>Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can have unwanted side effects. These are some common side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiredness</strong>. Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can make you feel exhausted and short of breath immediately after treatment. However, this can also be caused by anaemia, which is a common problem with established kidney failure. So it&rsquo;s not always easy to tell whether your fatigue is caused by dialysis or not</li>
<li><strong>Itchy skin and muscle cramps</strong>. These are usually caused by <strong>haemodialysis</strong>. The itchy skin is thought to be because of a build up of phosphate in your blood. The muscle cramps often happen in your lower legs as your muscles adjust to the fluid loss during dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs</strong>. People having either haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis sometimes get restless legs. This means that they have a strong urge to move their legs caused by an unpleasant feeling in these limbs. This feeling is worse when they are not active and at night.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-36">36</span>]<span id="reference-36" class="content-reference">Kavanagh D, Siddiqui S, Geddes CC. Restless legs syndrome in patients on dialysis. American Journal of Kidney Diseases. 2004; 43: 763-71.</span></li>
<li><strong>Low blood pressure</strong>. This is another common side effect of <strong>haemodialysis</strong>. It can be caused by the sudden drop in fluid levels that happens during dialysis. Low blood pressure can make you feel sick and dizzy during and soon after dialysis.</li>
<li><strong>Weight gain</strong>. The dialysis fluid used during <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> contains some sugars that are absorbed into the body and can make you gain weight, particularly if you aren&rsquo;t able to make changes to your diet or exercise regularly. One study found that around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure/7-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">7 in 100</a> &nbsp;people who have peritoneal dialysis put on 10 kg (1.5 stone) over two years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-37">37</span>]<span id="reference-37" class="content-reference">NHS Choices. Dialysis. August 2011. Available at http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Dialysis/Pages/Introduction.aspx (accessed on 13 June 2012).</span></li>
<li><strong>Hernia</strong>. A hernia occurs when an internal part of your body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall. People having <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> are at risk of developing a hernia because holding fluid inside the peritoneal cavity for many hours places strain on the muscles of the abdomen. Surgery is usually needed to repair a hernia. A hernia can make some movements difficult and painful, such as bending, coughing, lifting heavy objects, or having sex.</li>
<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>. People on any type of dialysis may not have the right amounts of minerals like calcium and phosphorus. This can cause pain in the bones and joints, weaker bones, and may make you more likely to have fractures and broken bones.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-38">38</span>]<span id="reference-38" class="content-reference">National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse.

</ul>
<p><strong>Problems with vascular access points</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, all three types of vascular access points can have problems that need further treatment or surgery. The most common problems are infections and blood clots. The access point may also close or become too narrow.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-39">39</span>]<span id="reference-39" class="content-reference">National Institutes of Health.

<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>
<p>Some people who have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> get an infection of the peritoneum, called <strong>peritonitis</strong>. The most common symptoms of peritonitis are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, a raised temperature, fever, and chills.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-41">41</span>]<span id="reference-41" class="content-reference">NHS Choices.

<p>People who have peritoneal dialysis can also get <strong>exit site infections. </strong>This is an infection of the area where the catheter comes out through the skin. This causes redness, tenderness, and sometimes pus to collect around the exit site.&nbsp;Occasionally, an exit site infection spreads down the catheter. This is called a <strong>tunnel infection</strong>. People who have a tunnel infection need an operation to remove the catheter.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-43">43</span>]<span id="reference-43" class="content-reference">UK National Kidney Federation. What problems can happen on PD? Available at http://www.kidney.org.uk/Medical-Info/pd/pdproblems.html (accessed on 30 May 2012.</span></p>
<p>People who have haemodialysis can also get infections. One of the most common infections is caused by bacteria called <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. In one study, <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure/90-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">90 people in every 100</a>&nbsp;who had haemodialysis got at least one <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection at some stage during dialysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-42">42</span>]<span id="reference-42" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>These infections can be treated with antibiotics. But if the bacteria get into the blood it can cause a serious condition called sepsis, which can cause death.

<p>If you have <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you will need to spend one or two days in hospital after an operation to put in a catheter. Most of your dialysis will happen at home (or wherever you are), but you may need time in hospital if you have infections or complications.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis</strong>, you need to carry out the fluid exchange procedure four times a day, every day. It takes about 45 minutes. Apart from that, you can walk around and get on with things. If you have <strong>automated peritoneal dialysis</strong>, dialysis takes place over eight to 10 hours, overnight, every night.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>haemodialysis</strong>, you will probably need to be attached to a dialysis machine at least three times a week, for at least four hours a session, although times vary from person to person. This may be at your home, or in a dialysis centre or hospital. You can&rsquo;t get up and move around while this is happening. You will also need blood tests and checks, to see whether your treatment is working well enough. The amount of time and the frequency of treatments varies for different people.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diet and fluid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>All types of dialysis involve some restrictions to your diet and what you can drink. This can take some adjustment for you and any family members who help prepare your meals. You will be able to speak to a dietitian or other member of your health care team to discuss how best to make changes to your diet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to restrict the amount of salt, potassium, and phosphate in your diet. You may also need to restrict the amount of fluid you drink. For haemodialysis, the restrictions on diet and fluids are likely to be stricter.</p></div>

The donor can either be someone who is living (often a family member or a friend) or someone who has just died (called a deceased donor).</p>
<p>A transplant can allow you to live your life much as you did before your kidneys stopped working. But it&rsquo;s not suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>The transplant process usually begins when you find out that your kidneys are failing and you are considering your treatment options. If you&rsquo;d like to be considered for a transplant, you&rsquo;ll be evaluated to see whether you are healthy enough for this operation and if there&rsquo;s a good chance that the transplant will succeed.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-47">47</span>]<span id="reference-47" class="content-reference">National Kidney Foundation.

<p>If you are a candidate for a transplant, the next step is finding a suitable kidney. You&rsquo;ll have tests to check your blood group as well as your tissue type, which involves looking at genetic markers called HLA factors (HLA is short for human leucocyte antigen). Kidneys that are a closer match tend to last longer.</p>
<p>Most people are put on a waiting list to find a suitable kidney from a person who has just died. But more and more people (over 1 in 3) now have a transplant with a kidney from a living donor, which provide the best chance for long-term transplant success.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-48">48</span>]<span id="reference-48" class="content-reference">Statistics and Clinical Audit, NHS Blood and Transplant.

<p><strong>The operation</strong></p>
<p>Whether you receive a kidney from a living or deceased donor, the transplant operation is essentially the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a general anaesthetic, so you will be asleep during the operation. The surgeon will make a cut in one side of your lower abdomen and insert the new kidney. This cut is usually around 15 to 20 centimetres long. The kidney&rsquo;s main blood vessels will be attached to those in your groin, and its ureter will be connected to your bladder (the ureter is the tube that drains urine from your kidney). Your damaged kidneys will probably be left in place.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-50">50</span>]<span id="reference-50" class="content-reference">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>Before or immediately after surgery, you will begin taking immunosuppressive (anti-rejection) medicines. These drugs suppress your immune system, making it less likely to attack the new kidney, causing your body to reject it. Your new kidney may start making urine straight away, or it may take days or weeks to start working. You&rsquo;ll be closely monitored, and may stay at hospital for one to two weeks.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>You can get back to your exercise routine after you&rsquo;ve recovered from your transplant surgery. You should avoid activities that may put your kidney at risk of injury (such as playing rugby and other contact sports).

<p><strong>Problems from the surgery and transplanted kidney</strong></p>
<p>A kidney transplant carries a risk of bleeding, infection, and reactions to the general anaesthetic, which can be serious.</p>
<p>After your surgery, you may get blood or urine leaking around your new kidney. If urine is leaking or blocked, you may need another operation. If a blood vessel leaks, you may need a blood transfusion and surgery to correct it. A blocked blood vessel is more serious. If the new kidney does not get enough blood, it may need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blood vessel may also become narrowed (this is called arterial stenosis). This can happen months or even years after your transplant, causing a rapid and potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure. You will probably need surgery to widen the blood vessel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a risk of dying from a kidney transplant, either from the surgery or from problems that arise soon after.

<p>There&rsquo;s a chance you may get an infection or cancer from a donated kidney. All kidneys and their donors are carefully screened to help prevent these problems, but no kidney is without risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problems from immunosuppressive medicines</strong></p>
<p>For a kidney transplant to last, you must take medicines long-term to prevent your body from rejecting the kidney. These are called immunosuppressive drugs. They &lsquo;suppress&rsquo; your immune system so it won&rsquo;t recognise the kidney as foreign and attack it.</p>
<p>There are many different types of immunosuppressive drugs, and most people take a combination of these. These drugs can cause a variety of side effects, including stomach irritation, hair growth or thinning, shaking of the hands (tremors), swollen gums, changes in appearance (for example, your face may become fuller), weight gain or loss, and spots (acne).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-64">64</span>]<span id="reference-64" class="content-reference">British National Formulary. Drugs affecting the immune response. Section 8.2. British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Also available at http://bnf.org (accessed on 7 June 2012).</span> Many of these problems may go away after you&rsquo;ve been taking the medicines for a while. Some of the drugs may also raise your risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and weak bones (osteoporosis).</p>
<p>The most serious side effects of these medicines are an increased risk of infections and cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infections</strong>: By suppressing your immune system, these drugs weaken your body&rsquo;s resistance to infections. This means you&rsquo;re more likely to become ill when you come in contact with viruses and other germs. And when you do get an infection, it may last longer than usual. Many people get infections of the urinary tract. If you get these frequently, this can damage your kidney. Your doctor may prescribe a regular low-dose antibiotic to prevent this. You are also more likely to become ill from infections that don&rsquo;t usually cause problems in people with fully functioning immune systems. These include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus. People who&rsquo;ve had a kidney transplant are usually advised to get vaccinated against the flu, pneumonia, and meningitis.</li>
<li><strong>Cancer</strong>: Immunosuppressive drugs increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Up to <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/established-kidney-failure/20-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a>&nbsp;people will develop cancer within 10 years of having a kidney transplant.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-65">65</span>]<span id="reference-65" class="content-reference">Lutz J, Heemann U.

To minimise your risk of skin cancer, it&rsquo;s important not to spend too much time in the sun (for example, sun-bathing) and to wear sunscreen or protective clothing.

If your kidneys stop working you may be told by your doctor that you have established kidney failure. This is sometimes called established renal failure (ERF), stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end stage renal failure (ESRF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose between treatments that do some of the work of your kidneys (dialysis and transplant) or treatments that manage the symptoms of kidney disease (conservative care). This decision aid helps you think about which treatment option will be best for you to manage your kidney disease from now on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialysis: where the treatment uses equipment to filter your blood and do some of the work of your kidney. There are four types of dialysis (see dialysis decision aid).</li>
<li>Kidney transplant: where a working kidney is given by another person (donor) during an operation. There are two types of kidney transplant (see kidney transplant decision aid).</li>
<li>Conservative care: where your symptoms are managed by medicines and diet. This treatment does not do the work of your kidney.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your experience of kidney disease, other health problems, and how healthy you are now can mean one treatment is medically better than another.&nbsp;Some people&rsquo;s medical history means they are not &nbsp;able to have a kidney transplant or one type of dialysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the types of decisions people with established kidney failure make:</p>
<ul>
<li>My kidney disease is getting worse. Is it better for me to have dialysis or conservative care?</li>
<li>My kidney disease is getting worse. Should I try to have a kidney transplant before I get symptoms?</li>
<li>I can have dialysis. Which type of dialysis fits best into my life?</li>
<li>I can have a kidney transplant. What kind of kidney transplant would I be happy with?</li>
<li>If I have conservative care, what choices do I have to make about my kidney disease and lifestyle?</li>
</ul>
<p>The right choice for you may change over time. This decision aid aims to help you make the right choice for you now. You may wish to choose different treatments as your illness or your life changes.</p>                    </div>

They are just below your ribcage, one on either side of your spine, at the back of the body. Every day the kidneys filter about 200 litres of fluid, removing 2 to 3 litres (more than 3 to 5 pints) of water and waste products from the blood. If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body.</p>
<p>Blood is moved through the kidneys in blood vessels. Tiny filters within the kidneys act like a sieve. They keep proteins and cells in the blood where they are needed. Extra fluid and waste is passed to the bladder in urine. The bladder stores urine until you go to the toilet. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which is needed to make red blood cells. Healthy kidneys help keep your blood pressure stable. And kidneys are important for absorbing the right amount of calcium and phosphate, which helps keep your bones strong.</p></div>

<p>You may also hear it called <strong>chronic renal failure</strong>, <strong>chronic kidney failure</strong>, or <strong>chronic renal insufficiency</strong>. Chronic means it&rsquo;s a long-term condition, and renal means it involves your kidneys.</p>
<p>Doctors use the term <strong>kidney function</strong> as a way to describe how well your kidneys filter blood. Kidney function can be measured with a blood test. Young people with two healthy kidneys usually have around 90 percent to 100 percent of their kidney function. Your kidney function tends to get lower with age. This isn&rsquo;t usually a problem, unless it keeps on getting lower.</p>
<p>People can lose some of their kidney function without it causing any problems or symptoms. But health problems begin when the kidneys can no longer do all their jobs well enough. When this happens varies from person to person. Some people might get symptoms when they still have quite a lot of kidney function, while others don&rsquo;t get symptoms even though they have lost more kidney function.</p></div>

If your blood tests show kidney function of 15 percent or less, this is called chronic kidney disease stage 5, also known as established kidney failure. You may also hear it called end stage kidney failure.</p>
<p>If you have established kidney failure, you may get symptoms because of waste building up in your blood. But this doesn&rsquo;t happen to everyone. You may not get symptoms until your kidney function is much lower than 15 percent.</p>

                <div data-cms-content-id="14_1_further-info_61"><p>Most people find out they have established kidney failure after having blood tests. The main blood test to diagnose established kidney failure is called a serum creatinine test.</p>
<p>Serum creatinine measures a chemical in the blood. It is used to calculate what is called the estimated glomular filtration rate (eGFR for short). The eGFR calculation is a calculation of how much blood your kidneys are able to filter in one minute. This number is about the same as your kidney function. So if you have 100 percent kidney function, your eGFR is also likely to be 100.</p>
<p>Your eGFR is used by doctors to put your kidney disease into &lsquo;stages&rsquo;.&nbsp; There are five stages of kidney disease. If you have completely normal kidney function, you have an eGFR of 90 or over. If you have an eGFR between 15 and 90, you have some kidney damage (stages 1 to 4).</p>
<p>If your eGFR is less than 15, you have chronic kidney disease stage 5, which is established kidney failure.</p></div>

<p>What happens to you will depend on many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your state of health, age, and any other illnesses you have</li>
<li>How quickly your kidney function is worsening</li>
<li>Which treatment you choose</li>

<ul>
<li>High blood pressure, which can increase your chances of a heart attack or stroke</li>
<li>Anaemia, which can make you very tired</li>
<li>Weaker bones, which means you are more likely to have a fracture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drugs can manage or prevent some of these complications. If you have been treated for chronic kidney disease, you may already be taking some of these medicines.</p>
<p>If you have established kidney failure, treatments can help take over the work of your kidneys and improve your symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney dialysis takes on some of the work of your kidneys, by removing the extra fluid and waste products from your blood.</li>
<li>A kidney transplant takes over all of the work of your kidneys, by providing you with a new kidney.</li>
<li>Conservative care treats your symptoms but does not take over the work of your kidneys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people with kidney disease have kidney function that stays stable, or gets lower only slowly. The speed at which your kidney function gets worse is one factor that may help you decide which treatment to choose.</p>
<p>But your kidney function is not the only thing that affects what happens to you. Your general state of health, age, and any other illnesses you have are also important.&nbsp;</p>
