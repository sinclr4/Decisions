<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

It stores a watery liquid made in the liver which is dark green to yellowish-brown in colour, called bile. Bile contains a number of substances including cholesterol, calcium and a yellowish substance called bilirubin which comes from old, used up red blood cells that are processed in the liver.</p>
<p>The liver makes up to a litre of bile each day, and most of it goes down tubes from the liver into the intestine where it helps to digest fat [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">US National Library of Medicine.

<li>Hiatus hernia: the upper part of the stomach pushes back into the chest area through a tear in the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen)</li>

<li>A family doctor (GP) will ask about symptoms and other factors that may increase the likelihood of gallstones (see Why Do I Have Gallstones?). The GP will also examine a person&rsquo;s abdomen to see if it is sore near the gallbladder, and to check for other possible reasons for the symptoms, such as liver or intestinal problems. If gallstones seem likely, the GP will make an appointment for the person to have other tests and to see a specialist</li>
<li>They will have blood tests, including tests to check that their liver is working properly and an ultrasound scan to see if there are gallstones in the gallbladder or bile ducts. If there is a gallstone in the bile duct a different procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be suggested. An ultrasound scan is a painless test in which harmless sound waves are bounced off the abdomen in order to get pictures of internal organs and structures</li>
<li>At an outpatient appointment at the hospital, a person with suspected gallstones will see a specialist in intestinal diseases who will discuss their symptoms and examine them. At the hospital, people sometimes have other types of scans to check the gallbladder and nearby structures.</li>

<p>Not having a gallbladder isn&rsquo;t harmful as bile stored in the gallbladder is not essential for digestion.</p>
<p>The gallbladder can be removed under a general anaesthetic by:&nbsp;[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-28">28</span>]<span id="reference-28" class="content-reference">NHS Choices. Gallstones. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Laparoscopiccholecystectomy/Pages/Whathappenspage.aspx</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most commonly used way of removing the gallbladder. The surgeon makes three or four small cuts (incisions) in the abdomen, each about 1cm or less. One incision is in the bellybutton and the others are on the right side of the abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is put in through a tube in one of the incisions to inflate the abdomen so that the surgeon can see the internal organs. Through the incision in the belly button goes a long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera on the end. This is called a laparoscope. The surgeon looks at a monitor while removing the gallbladder using tiny surgical instruments inserted into the other incisions.</li>
<li>Open surgery is sometimes used to remove the gallbladder, should it become necessary to do so during the operation eg: because they can&rsquo;t see the gallbladder and surrounding tissues clearly enough or&nbsp;if a person has other illnesses that make it safer to do open surgery than laparoscopic surgery.&nbsp;Open surgery means making a single large incision (about 10-15cm) in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder with standard size surgical instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some variations in the way surgeons do laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day-case or overnight: most people can have laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the day surgery unit of their hospital, so they go home the same day as their operation, or they can spend the night after their surgery in hospital. If problems arise during surgery, people sometimes need to stay one or more days in hospital whether or not they had planned to have their gallbladder out as day surgery.</li>
<li>Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the gallbladder is removed through a single small incision in the bellybutton which is used to insert all of the equipment that is needed [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-29">29</span>]<span id="reference-29" class="content-reference">NICE.

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. N2182, 2010</span></li>
<li>2D or 3D: in an effort to reduce the number of operations that start as keyhole surgery but switch to open surgery some surgeons are using 3D instead of 2D video cameras on their laparoscopes to look inside the body and see the gallbladder and other structures [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Gurusamy, K.

<ul>
<li>Painkillers to relieve the pain that people with gallstones get in their abdomen. Examples are non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac and stronger painkillers such as morphine and pethidine</li>
<li>Antispasmodics, for example hyoscine, that relax the muscles of the gallbladder and intestine and reduce painful spasms that occur when the gallbladder is blocked by gallstones</li>
<li>Bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid (Urso), which aim to dissolve small bile stones and prevent them from forming again. Taking Urso reduces the amount of cholesterol that the liver makes and changes the mix of bile acids in bile so that it is less likely to form gallstones. They are not suitable for certain types of stones such as larger ones and there is little evidence for their effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lifestyle changes to treat gallstones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding fatty foods which contain a lot of cholesterol, such as pies, sausages, fatty meat, butter and margarine, cakes and biscuits</li>
<li>Losing weight if you are overweight by eating a healthy diet and taking more exercise. Rapid weight loss on a very low calorie diet can upset the balance of chemicals in the bile and increase the likelihood of getting gallstones. Losing weight slowly by eating less sweet, fatty food, and more vegetables and fruit, and taking regular exercise is more healthy.</li>

If gallstones are small, they may pass into the intestine and out of the body, and switching to a low fat diet and eating healthily may prevent them from recurring.</p>
<p>People who use painkillers or antispasmodic drugs to treat symptoms may feel better in a few days or weeks, or it may take longer. These drugs do not make the gallstones go away.</p>
<p>How long people need to take Urso treatment to try to dissolve gallstones varies. The length of a course of treatment will depend how much and how quickly the gallstones shrink.
