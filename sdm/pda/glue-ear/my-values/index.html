<p>The ear is made up of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outer ear. This is the bit of the ear we can see. It captures the vibrations from the outside world and directs them towards the middle ear.</li>
<li>Middle ear. This is made up of the eardrum and three tiny bones (ossicles) connected in a row. It is usually filled with air. Vibrations from the outside world make the eardrum vibrate. The three tiny bones carry the vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.</li>
<li>Inner ear.&nbsp;This&nbsp;has a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea which&nbsp;translates&nbsp;the vibration of the fluid within the cochlea into electrical signals. These electrical&nbsp;signals&nbsp;pass to the brain through a nerve (the auditory nerve) where they are translated into sounds.</li>

<p>A thin tube called the eustachian tube runs from the ear to the back of the nose. It brings air to the middle ear and also drains fluid away from the middle ear.</p>
<p>Glue ear mainly happens to children, because the eustachian tubes are not fully developed, and therefore don&rsquo;t work well at letting air into the middle ear to drain the fluid away. Research tells us that there is a genetic component that makes people more susceptible to contracting glue ear.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Kvestad E, Kvaerner KJ, R&oslash;ysamb E, et al.

                <div data-cms-content-id="158_1_further-info_818"><p>Most children find out they have glue ear after seeing their doctor with hearing problems.&nbsp;Glue ear can be difficult for parents or carers to spot because sometimes there are no obvious symptoms or signs.</p>
<p>If you do have earache, high temperature, and vomiting you may have&nbsp;<strong>acute otitis media</strong>. Acute otitis media is caused by an infection.&nbsp;It is not glue ear.&nbsp;Glue ear is not caused by an infection. However, children who keep getting acute otitis media may be more likely to get glue ear.</p>
<p>Your doctor will check if you have glue ear by looking inside your ears with a device called a pneumatic otoscope. They will also use a small bulb to blow a puff of air into your ear. In a healthy ear, the puff of air will make the eardrum move. If you have glue ear, the eardrum won&rsquo;t move much because fluid will be pushing up against it from behind.</p>
<p>Other things your doctor will check for are changes to the colour of your eardrum and bubbles behind the eardrum.</p>
<p>Your doctor may ask you to see a specialist for further tests if they think you have glue ear, and if you have had symptoms for more than three months. The specialist usually performs two tests to check if you have glue ear.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audiometry</strong>. The test used will depend on your age. In young children, visual response audiometry or play audiometry is used. In this test you hear sounds through speakers. In older children, pure tone audiometry is used. This test uses a device called an audiometer. This device plays sounds at different volumes and frequencies to check how much you can and can&rsquo;t hear. You will wear headphones for the test.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tympanometry</strong>. This test uses a machine called a tympanometer. Attached to the machine is an earpiece which is placed in the outer ear. The earpiece changes the air pressure in the ear and plays a sound. The machine then measures how well the eardrum is working.</li>

                <div data-cms-content-id="158_1_further-info_819"><p>Everyone with glue ear will have some hearing loss. The average hearing loss is about 24 decibels (dB). Decibels are a measure of how loud sounds are. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound of someone breathing is about 10 dB.</li>
<li>A whisper is about 15 to 20 dB.</li>
<li>The voice of a teacher at the back of the classroom is 40 dB.</li>
<li>Normal conversation is about 50 to 60 dB.</li>
<li>A vacuum cleaner is about 80 dB.</li>
<li>A jet taking off (if you&rsquo;re standing nearby) is about 120 dB.</li>
</ul>
<p>A loss of 24 dB of hearing is similar to a person with normal hearing putting a finger in each ear. Hearing loss with glue ear can be as much as 45 dB if the fluid trapped in the middle ear is very thick.</p>
<p>A loss of 24 dB of hearing is less likely to cause speech, learning, or behaviour problems. But it is important that your child's school is aware of the hearing loss so that they can make appropriate adjustments to ensure your child isn't disadvantaged within the classroom. A hearing loss of 45 dB may affect speech, learning, and behaviour.</p>
<p>The hearing loss caused by glue ear usually goes away once fluid in the middle ear is cleared up.</p></div>

<p>Glue ear normally goes away completely as children get older. Some children get glue ear that doesn&rsquo;t go away, others will keep getting glue ear. We don&rsquo;t know why this happens to some children.</p>
<p>The main problem with glue ear is its effect on hearing. Hearing problems can last for a long time in some children with glue ear. This may cause difficulties with school, learning, and speech and language development.</p></div>

<p>Other treatments sometimes used for glue ear that you might hear about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antibiotics. These are drugs that kill bacteria.&nbsp;Children with glue ear are prone to frequent ear infections. But research tells us that there is not a substantial improvement in hearing as a result of the use of antibiotics for glue ear. In some special circumstances, however, antibiotics may be used.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-11">11</span>]<span id="reference-11" class="content-reference">van Zon A, van der Heijden GJ, van Dongen TM, et al. Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children (Cochrane review). In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span></li>
<li>Nasal balloons. This involves blowing up a balloon through each nostril three times a day. Blowing into balloons may help open up your eustachian tubes, which could cut your chances of getting glue ear. Doctors are testing nasal balloons on children aged 4 to 11 years to see how well they work.</li>
<li>Oral steroids. These are tablets that can reduce inflammation. They are not often used because taking them for long periods of time can cause serious side effects for children, such as stopping or slowing their growth. But the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) is funding a large study to test how well these drugs work in children with glue ear when used short-term.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme.

<p>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and influenza vaccines protect young children against pneumococcal and influenza infections, which are a common cause of middle ear infections. But they don&rsquo;t prevent glue ear.</p></div>

<p>If you can hear better with hearing aids, it may make it easier for you to do things like understand what people are saying, follow conversations, hear the TV, and listen to music. You may be able to do more and feel less frustrated and annoyed if you can hear things better.</p>
<p>You can go swimming if you have hearing aids. Diving or swimming below the surface of the water will increase the pressure on your eardrum and this may give you pain in your ear. If your hearing aids are not waterproof, you will need to take them off before swimming.</p>
<p>You can travel by plane if you have hearing aids. You may feel pain in your ear when you fly because of the change in air pressure, especially during take-off and landing.</p></div>

<p>Some children who use hearing aids say they are uncomfortable. Some say they can hear background noise, whistling noise and feedback, and the hearing aid makes noises too loud. But hearing aids shouldn&rsquo;t cause these issues if they are well fitted by a good audiologist. Some older children find them embarrassing to wear, although nowadays hearing aids are very small and don't look obvious.</p>
<p>If a hearing aid is turned up too loud, it can cause something called overamplification. A hearing aid that is too loud might seem to make it easier to hear sounds but it can cause more damage to hearing over time. Your doctor or audiologist will be able to tell you more about how loud your hearing aid should be.</p>
<p>Children can lose hearing aids, or sometimes accidentally swallow the battery.</p></div>

This surgery involves putting a tiny plastic tube (grommet) into your eardrum.&nbsp;This helps to drain glue away from the middle ear and let air in, which means the eardrum can vibrate properly and you can hear better.</p>
<p>Most grommets stay in the eardrum for about seven months.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-23">23</span>]<span id="reference-23" class="content-reference">Kalcioglu MT, Cokkeser Y, Kizilay A, et al. Follow-up of 366 ears after tympanostomy tube insertion: why is it draining? Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery. 2003; 128: 560-564.</span> Some grommets are designed to stay in the ear for longer (two to three years). Most grommets fall out naturally. It doesn't hurt when they fall out and the hole in the eardrum usually heals by itself.</p>
<p>You may also have an operation to take out your adenoids. This operation is called an <strong>adenoidectomy</strong>. Adenoids are small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose. They help trap germs as part of the body's immune system. If your adenoids become infected and swollen, the infection may spread to the middle ear and can block your eustachian tubes and prevent glue draining away from their middle ear. Having your adenoids taken out may help prevent your eustachian tubes from getting blocked. This may help your glue ear.</p>
<p>Grommet surgery is carried out by a surgeon in a hospital under general anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep throughout the operation. If you have your adenoids taken out, it may be done at the same time as having grommet surgery, and under the same general anaesthetic. You won't have any visible cuts or scarring if you have these operations.</p></div>

<p>Most children with glue ear who have grommet surgery have an improvement in their hearing of around 12 dB three months after surgery. An improvement of 12 decibels (dB) is like being able to hear breathing and some whispers if you were unable to hear these sounds before. Six to nine months after surgery, this improvement in hearing decreases to about 4 dB. <span class="content-reference">[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">Browning GG, Rovers MM, Williamson I, et al.
