                <div data-cms-content-id="261_1_further-info_1224"><p>Blood pressure&nbsp;is a measure of&nbsp;how strongly your blood pushes against your blood vessels (arteries) as it moves around your body, and how your&nbsp;blood vessels absorb the force of your blood pushing against them.</p>
<p>To understand why you have high blood pressure and how treatments work, it helps to know a bit about how blood flows through your body and what controls the pressure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your blood is pumped around the body by your heart.</li>
<li>Blood leaves the heart through your arteries. This blood carries oxygen and food to all the cells in your body.</li>
<li>You need a certain amount of pressure to keep blood moving through your arteries.</li>
<li>When your heart beats, it pushes blood out and around your body. This causes the pressure to rise. Your blood pressure is lowest when the heart relaxes and fills with blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two parts to your blood pressure reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first (upper) number is your systolic pressure. It measures the pressure of the blood when your heart pushes blood out.</li>
<li>The second (lower) number is your diastolic pressure. This is the pressure measured when your heart relaxes and fills up with blood.</li>
<li>Blood pressure is measured as millimetres of mercury (mmHg). So, a blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg&nbsp;means your systolic blood pressure is 145 and your diastolic blood pressure is 95. If you have high blood pressure, you may have a high systolic blood pressure, a high diastolic blood pressure, or both.</li>

It&rsquo;s also normal for your blood pressure to rise and fall throughout the day and the night. There&rsquo;s no cut-off point that means you will definitely have high blood pressure that causes you health problems.</p>
<p>If your blood pressure goes up and stays up it's called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is also called 'hypertension'.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses say you have high blood pressure if, over a period of time, either your upper (systolic) blood pressure has been 140 mmHg&nbsp;or higher, or your lower (diastolic) blood pressure has been 90 mmHg or higher.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>No one knows exactly what goes on in your body to cause high blood pressure.

BMJ. 2012; 344: e3953.</span> Most people have no symptoms and only find out they have high blood pressure when it causes them health problems. Over time, high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels and increase your chances of having a heart attack or a stroke. It can also lead to kidney disease and heart failure. If your high blood pressure causes you other health problems, you may get symptoms.</p>
<p>Very rarely, untreated blood pressure can rise suddenly without any warning and get very high. It is very serious and can lead to death. People with blood pressure this high need treatment straight away.</p>
<p>The symptoms of this type of severe high blood pressure include: a bad headache, feeling confused, nausea,&nbsp;restlessness or feeling dizzy. If you have these symptoms, you should see a doctor urgently.

<p>There are certain things that increase the risk of high blood pressure. These are called risk factors. Your high blood pressure may be caused by a combination of risk factors. Some of the most common risk factors for high blood pressure are:</p>
<p><strong>Getting older</strong><br />Our systolic (and, to a lesser extent, our diastolic) blood pressure tends to go up as we get older. For example, just under <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/High-blood-pressure/10-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">10 in 100</a> men aged between 16 and 24 have high blood pressure, compared with <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/High-blood-pressure/60-100.jpg" class="image-reference">60 in 100</a> men aged between 65 and 74.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">British Heart Foundation. Coronary heart disease statistics 2008. July 2008. Available at: http://www.bhf.org.uk (accessed on 18 December 2012).</span> The same is true for women.</p>
<p><strong>Being pregnant</strong><br />Up to <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/High-blood-pressure/10-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">10 in 100</a> pregnant women get high blood pressure (called gestational high blood pressure).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Williams B, Poulter NR, Brown MJ, et al.

Journal of Human Hypertension. 2004; 18: 139-185.</span> This can go away on its own without treatment. It can sometimes be linked to a condition called pre-eclampsia. Because pre-eclampsia can cause women to go into labour too early, or lead to babies weighing too little when they are born, your doctor will keep a close check on your blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Your ethnic group</strong><br />In the UK, people of black African or Caribbean origin are more likely to have high blood pressure than other British people.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Williams B, Poulter NR, Brown MJ, et al.

<p><strong>Being overweight</strong><br />If you are overweight you are more likely to have high blood pressure than someone who is of normal weight.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p><strong>Not exercising enough</strong><br />If you don't get regular exercise, your chances of getting high blood pressure are much higher than for someone who is active and fit.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">Chobanian AV, Bakris GL, Black HR, et al.

<p><strong>What you eat and drink</strong><br />Your diet, and how much alcohol you drink, can affect your blood pressure. If you have more than two alcoholic drinks a day, you are up to twice as likely to get high blood pressure as someone who doesn't drink.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-13">13</span>]<span id="reference-13" class="content-reference">Fuchs FD, Chambless LE, Whelton PK, et al.

<p><strong>Stress</strong><br />There is some evidence that being in a very stressful situation can push up your blood pressure for a short time. We don't know whether feeling stressed has a lasting effect on your blood pressure because there hasn't been enough research on this to be sure.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-17">17</span>]<span id="reference-17" class="content-reference">Beevers G, Lip GY, O'Brien E (eds). ABC of hypertension. 4th edition. BMJ Books, London, UK; 2001.</span> If you cope with stress by smoking, drinking alcohol, or eating more, this can raise your blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Other health problems<br /></strong>You are more likely to have high blood pressure if you have certain other health problems. You are at higher risk of having high blood pressure if your have high cholesterol, some heart diseases (such as left ventricular hypertrophy),&nbsp;kidney disease, or diabetes.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

The only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have it measured. It&rsquo;s most likely to be a nurse who checks your blood pressure as part of your general health check at your GP surgery.</p>
<p><strong>The blood pressure test</strong><br />Blood pressure is measured with a device called a sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure is measured as millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</p>
<p>To measure your blood pressure, a nurse wraps a cuff around your upper arm, above your elbow. Some&nbsp;can be placed on or around your wrist.&nbsp;Your nurse will pump air into the cuff to tighten it and then slowly release the air in the cuff. Newer machines show your blood pressure on a digital reading. Older machines show your blood pressure on a gauge. Your nurse may read a gauge while they use a stethoscope to listen for the sound of the blood rushing back through.</p>
<p>Your nurse should check your blood pressure in both arms, and may check it more than once.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>Your blood pressure can go up and down, depending on the time of day and what you're doing. So to confirm if you have high blood pressure all the time, you&rsquo;ll need to have your blood pressure measured at home, for 24 hours.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>This is called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM for short). You wear a small, light device that takes measurements of your blood pressure (at least two every hour) while you move around and do normal things. You wear the monitor for a day and then return it to your GP surgery. Your ambulatory blood pressure reading is the average of all the readings taken during the day.</p>

<p>Not everyone can have ambulatory blood pressure readings done over 24 hours. If your doctor or nurse doesn't use ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, he or she should still take several readings before deciding that you have high blood pressure. A single reading is not enough. Your doctor or&nbsp;nurse&nbsp;may ask you to use a machine to take blood pressure readings at home, over four to seven days. This is called home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM for short), and is a different type of machine to an ambulatory blood pressure monitor. You&rsquo;ll still need to go back to your GP surgery with the readings, to confirm if you have high blood pressure.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>There are some general things we can say about high blood pressure and the health problems it can lead to. The main health problems related to high blood pressure are heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and kidney failure.</p>
<p><strong>Heart attacks and strokes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure can damage the walls of your blood vessels. The damage to the wall makes it easier for fatty material to stick to it. This can cause blood clots to form.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-17">17</span>]<span id="reference-17" class="content-reference">Beevers G, Lip GY, O'Brien E (eds). ABC of hypertension. 4th edition. BMJ Books, London, UK; 2001.</span></li>
<li>If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to your heart it can lead to a heart attack. If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to your brain it can lead to a stroke.</li>
<li>The higher your blood pressure and the longer it stays high, the greater your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke.</li>
<li>Not everybody with high blood pressure will get heart disease or have a stroke. There are many things that affect your chances of getting heart disease other than blood pressure. Your personal risk will depend on whether you have other risk factors, such as whether you smoke.</li>
<li>The people who are at the greatest risk of having a heart attack or a stroke are those who already have signs of heart disease.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-30">30</span>]<span id="reference-30" class="content-reference">World Health Organization and International Society of Hypertension. Guidelines for the management of hypertension. Journal of Hypertension. 1999; 17: 151-185.</span></li>
<li>If you have angina (a type of chest pain that you get especially when you exert yourself) or if you've already had a heart attack, your chances of having a heart attack or stroke are higher if your blood pressure is high. If this is the case, your doctor will pay extra attention to your blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heart failure</strong><br />If your blood pressure is high, your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your blood vessels. Over time, the extra work damages the heart. Eventually the damage can cause heart failure.</p>
<p>The main symptom of heart failure is being short of breath, even after doing something that shouldn't make you feel so tired (for example, walking up a few stairs). You may also get swollen ankles and feel very tired.</p>
<p><strong>Kidney failure</strong><br />If the blood vessels in your kidneys become narrow and damaged because of high blood pressure, your kidneys may not work properly. Over time they may stop working completely.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Mulrow CD. Evidence based hypertension.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="261_2_further-info_1241_0"><p>Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure are a range of things that you can do to help bring your blood pressure down.</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes can include things like taking regular exercise, stopping smoking if you are a smoker, and complementary therapies to help you relax, like meditation and yoga. Your nurse or GP can help you find appropriate lifestyle changes that can help reduce your blood pressure.</p>
<p>This Patient Decision Aid will focus on the effects of lifestyle changes that we&rsquo;re fairly sure can help bring down blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing your diet</li>
<li>Getting regular physical exercise</li>
<li>Cutting down the amount of salt in your diet</li>
<li>Losing weight if you are overweight</li>
<li>Cutting down the amount of alcohol you drink.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changing your diet</strong></p>
<p>The DASH (which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet has high amounts of fruits and vegetables and low amounts of fatty foods. On this diet you eat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less saturated fat (found in butter, meat, cheese, and cream)</li>
<li>Less cholesterol (found in saturated fats, eggs, and dairy products)</li>
<li>Lots of fruit (five servings a day)</li>
<li>Lots of vegetables (five servings a day)</li>
<li>Small amounts of dairy products</li>
<li>Wholegrain products (such as brown rice and wholemeal bread)</li>
<li>Fish, poultry, and nuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the DASH diet you avoid red meat, sweets, and sugary drinks. There are no special foods and no hard-to-follow recipes.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Being physically active means getting a moderate amount of activity regularly. Types of exercise that could help include walking briskly, swimming with moderate effort, or cycling at a moderate speed. Doctors recommend that you exercise at a moderate intensity (enough to feel your heart beating faster and be out of breath) for 30 minutes, five times a week.</p>
<p><strong>Salt reduction</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the amount of salt in your diet means changing the types of food you eat, and perhaps using 'low salt' instead of table salt. A low-salt diet means eating less than 6 grams (or one teaspoon) of table salt a day.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">Williams B, Poulter NR, Brown MJ, et al. The BHS Guidelines Working Party guidelines for management of hypertension: report of the fourth working party of the British Hypertension Society, 2004-BHS IV. Journal of Human Hypertension. 2004; 18: 139-185.</span> This is the same as 2.4 grams of sodium. On average, adults in the UK eat 7 to 10 grams of salt a day.</p>
<p><strong>Losing weight</strong></p>
<p>This means, if you are overweight, losing enough weight so that you are at the recommended weight for a person the same height as you. To lose weight, you have to eat fewer calories than you burn.</p>
<p>You can do this by following a weight loss programme that includes a diet and exercise. You may also have behaviour therapy to help you change the way you eat and exercise. Your weight loss programme may also include drugs. You should aim to lose 0.5 to 1 kilogram (1 to 2 pounds) each week.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting down on alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Drinking less alcohol means cutting back to the recommended limit of no more than three units of alcohol a day for men, and no more than two units a day for women.</p>
<p>Different beers and wines contain different amounts of alcohol. As a general guide: a small glass (125 millilitres) of wine, half a pint of ordinary strength lager, or a single shot (25 millilitres) of a spirit (such as whisky or gin) all contain around one unit of alcohol.</p></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about the different ways making lifestyle changes can help if you have high blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Physical exercise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In one group of people, regular physical exercise lowered their systolic blood pressure by an average of 3.1 mmHg and their diastolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Hypertension: clinical management of primary hypertension in adults. August 2011. Available at: http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG127 (accessed on 18 December 2012).</span></li>
<li>People with high blood pressure who get any amount of physical activity are between 16% and 67% less likely to die of heart problems, and between 15% and 57% less likely to die early from any cause, than people with high blood pressure who don&rsquo;t exercise at all.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-42">42</span>]<span id="reference-42" class="content-reference">Rossi A, Dikareva A, Bacon SL. The impact of physical activity on mortality in patients with high blood pressure: a review. Journal of Hypertension. 2012; 30: 1277-1288.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing your salt intake</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In one group of people who reduced the amount of salt in their diet to&nbsp;less than&nbsp;6 grams (around one teaspoon) a day, their systolic blood pressure fell by 3.4 mmHg and their diastolic blood pressure by 2.2 mmHg. Around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/High-blood-pressure/23-100.jpg" class="image-reference">23 people in 100</a> with high blood pressure who reduced the amount of salt in their diet were likely to reduce their systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Hypertension: clinical management of primary hypertension in adults. August 2011. Available at: http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG127 (accessed on 18 December 2012).</span></li>
<li>In one group of people, reducing the amount of salt in their diet didn&rsquo;t make a difference to how likely people were to die early of heart problems related to high blood pressure. This group included a mix of people with normal and high blood pressure, so we can&rsquo;t be sure what the effects of reducing salt intake are on how likely people with high blood pressure are to die of health problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-44">44</span>]<span id="reference-44" class="content-reference">Taylor RS, Ashton KE, Moxham T, et al. Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Cochrane Review). American Journal of Hypertension. 2011; 24: 843-853.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Losing weight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In one group of people who were overweight, following low-calorie diets reduced their systolic blood pressure by 6 mmHg and their diastolic blood pressure by 4.8 mmHg. Around <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/High-blood-pressure/40-100.jpg" class="image-reference">40 in 100</a> people who followed these kinds of diets were likely to reduce their systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg.</li>
<li>In one group of people who followed a diet designed to help them lose weight, losing an average of 4 kg (around 9 lbs) helped them reduce their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-45">45</span>]<span id="reference-45" class="content-reference">Siebenhofer A, Jeitler K, Berghold A, et al. Long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in hypertensive patients (Cochrane review). Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Following a healthy diet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combining a healthy diet with an exercise programme can lower blood pressure more than following either a healthy diet or an exercise programme alone. In one group of people, exercising for between 30 and 60 minutes five times a week reduced their blood pressure by around 6.7 mmHg. People who exercised and followed the DASH diet reduced their blood pressure by an average of 12.1 mmHg.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-46">46</span>]<span id="reference-46" class="content-reference">Edwards KM, Wilson KL, Sadja J, et al.

Acta Physiologica. 2011; 203: 343-350.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cutting down on alcohol</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drinking more than 21 units a week for men and more than 14 units a week for women increases blood pressure. People who drink more than this amount get more health problems than people who drink less.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>Making some kinds of lifestyle changes to lower your blood pressure can improve your quality of life and how you feel. In one group of people with high blood pressure between 120 and 159 mmHg systolic and 80 and 95 mmHg diastolic, those who exercised for at least three hours a week, reduced their sodium intake to 2.3 grams a day or less, and followed the DASH diet, had a better quality of life and felt better than people who didn't make these changes.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-49">49</span>]<span id="reference-49" class="content-reference">Young DR, Coughlin J, Jerome GJ, et al.

<p>Physical activity can cause injuries like joint sprains and muscle strains. Most people don't need to see their GP before they start to exercise at a moderate level. But you should check with your GP first if you've had a heart attack or other serious health problems in the past.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that eating a low-fat diet that includes lots of fruit and vegetables (the DASH diet) is harmful. Some people may get diarrhoea or feel bloated.</p>
<p>Most people won't get any problems from reducing their alcohol intake. If you're a very heavy drinker and you stop drinking suddenly, you can get withdrawal symptoms. If you have these symptoms you may need help from a doctor or nurse to deal with them.</p>
<p>Reducing the amount of salt you eat probably won't hurt you, as most people eat too much.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="261_2_further-info_1242_0"><p>Drug treatments for high blood pressure are medicines that you take to help lower your blood pressure. There are lots of different blood pressure medicines available, but this Patient Decision Aid will look at six types of drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACE inhibitors</strong>. ACE stands for angiotensin converting enzyme. It's a chemical that's produced naturally by the body. ACE inhibitors can stop your blood vessels narrowing. This allows blood to pass more easily along your blood vessels and lowers your blood pressure. Some common ACE inhibitors&nbsp;are enalapril, ramipril, perindopril and lisinopril.</li>
<li><strong>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</strong>. Angiotensin II receptor blockers can stop your blood vessels narrowing. This allows blood to pass more easily along your blood vessels and lowers your blood pressure. Some common angiotensin II receptor blockers&nbsp;are candesartan, losartan, valsartan and irbesartan.</li>
<li><strong>Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)</strong>. Calcium channel blockers can help keep your blood vessels relaxed and open. This makes it easier for your blood to flow, which lowers your blood pressure. Some common calcium channel blockers&nbsp;are amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine and nifedipine.</li>
<li><strong>Diuretics</strong>. These drugs help your body get rid of extra water. They are sometimes called water tablets because they work by flushing excess salt and water from your body in your urine. This lowers your blood pressure. A group of diuretics called thiazides are usually used to treat high blood pressure. Some of the most common ones&nbsp;are bendroflumethiazide, chlortalidone, and indapamide. Another type of diuretic is called spironolactone. This is usually used if you have tried other drug treatments and still have high blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>. Beta-blockers work by slowing down your heartbeat. They also reduce the force that blood is pumped at each heartbeat. Some common beta-blockers&nbsp;are&nbsp;bisoprolol, atenolol, and metoprolol.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha-blockers</strong>. These drugs can help keep your blood vessels relaxed and open, making it easier for blood to flow through them. This lowers your blood pressure. Some alpha-blockers&nbsp;are doxazosin and&nbsp;prazosin.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to take more than one medicine to bring your blood pressure down. Most people need at least two drugs. Which kinds of drug work best depends on your age and your ethnic background. This is because some drugs work better in younger people (aged under 55) and others work better in people older than this. Some drugs work better in black people (of African or Caribbean origin) and others work better in people from other ethnic backgrounds.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<li><strong>Dizziness</strong>. Sometimes these drugs can lower your blood pressure too quickly. This can make you feel faint. You're most likely to get dizzy the very first time that you take the drug. Because of this side effect, your GP will increase the dose of the drug slowly. Your GP may also suggest taking the tablet at bedtime so you don't feel dizzy.</li>
<li><strong>Changes in the level of potassium in your blood</strong>. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can cause the potassium in your blood to rise. Diuretics can cause the potassium in your blood to go down. These changes&nbsp;can cause an abnormal heartbeat, possibly leading to death.
