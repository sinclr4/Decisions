                <div data-cms-content-id="273_1_further-info_1314"><p>Cholesterol is a type of fat. The body needs cholesterol to help build cells, and to make some hormones, vitamin D, and a substance called bile that helps digestion. There is cholesterol in every cell in the body.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Heart UK. Cholesterol. Available at http://heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol-health/cholesterol (accessed on 20 February 2013).</span></p>
<p>Most cholesterol is made by the liver from the fats you eat. You can also get some cholesterol directly from foods, such as egg yolks, dairy products, liver, kidney, and shellfish. To move around the body, cholesterol is carried in the blood attached to proteins. This combination is called a <strong>lipoprotein</strong>&nbsp;because it's made up of a lipid (the name for fat when it's in the blood) and a protein. There are two main types of lipoprotein, and they have different roles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low density lipoprotein (LDL):</strong> This type carries most of the cholesterol around the body to where it is needed. &lsquo;Low density&rsquo; means that it is lower in protein and higher in fat. Although LDL cholesterol performs an important role, it is often called &lsquo;<strong>bad cholesterol</strong>&rsquo;. This is because, if someone has too much LDL cholesterol, they can get a build up of cholesterol in blood vessels called arteries. This can make it difficult for blood to flow through them.</li>
<li><strong>High density lipoprotein (HDL):</strong> This type of lipoprotein is higher in protein and lower in fat than LDL. Instead of transporting cholesterol around the body, it sucks up extra cholesterol and returns it to the liver. HDL cholesterol is often called &lsquo;<strong>good cholesterol</strong>&rsquo; because it helps prevent cholesterol from building up in the arteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>When doctors talk about cholesterol, they may also talk about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total cholesterol</strong>. This is the total amount of cholesterol in the blood, including both good (HDL) and bad (LDL) cholesterol.</li>
<li><strong>Total cholesterol to HDL ratio</strong>. This is the balance between your overall cholesterol and your good (HDL) cholesterol. The lower the result is, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Non-HDL cholesterol</strong>. This is your total cholesterol minus your good (HDL) cholesterol.</li>
<li><strong>Triglycerides</strong>. These are another type of fat in the blood. High levels of triglycerides can be harmful. Many people who have too much bad (LDL) cholesterol in their blood also have high levels of triglycerides.</li>
</ul></div>

                                <dt class="title" role="tab" aria-controls="content-1315-2" tabindex="0" id="title-1315-2">What is high cholesterol?</dt>

                <div data-cms-content-id="273_1_further-info_1315"><p>The name 'high cholesterol' is a bit misleading. Your cholesterol levels can actually be relatively low but still be higher than is healthy for you, based on your overall risk of heart and circulation problems. You may also hear doctors say you have an 'abnormal cholesterol profile'.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, it can mean one, or a combination, of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall level of cholesterol in your blood is too high&nbsp;</li>
<li>You have too much bad (LDL) cholesterol in your blood</li>
<li>You have too little good (HDL) cholesterol in your blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will look at other cholesterol measurements as well, including the overall level of cholesterol in relation to your good (HDL) cholesterol&nbsp;(called the total cholesterol to HDL ratio).</p>
<p>Having high cholesterol levels can lead to heart and circulation problems, as fatty deposits called <strong>plaques</strong> can build up along the inside of the arteries. These plaques can clog up the arteries, making them narrower. This condition is called <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>, and it can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>There are no clearly defined levels of cholesterol that mean you will definitely have heart and circulation problems, or will definitely avoid them. This is because your chance of heart and circulation problems depends on other things as well, including whether you smoke and have other health problems (for example, high blood pressure). Your doctor will use a calculator&nbsp;&ndash; such as the Qrisk calculator (<a href="http://www.qrisk.org">http://www.qrisk.org</a>)&nbsp;&ndash; to work out your risk. This will show whether you might benefit from treatment to lower your cholesterol.</p>
<p>High cholesterol is a long-term (chronic) condition. Treatments can help bring your cholesterol to a healthy level. You will probably continue with these treatments for the rest of your life.</p></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>What you eat</strong>: Eating a lot of saturated fats and trans fats is likely to increase the amount of bad (LDL) cholesterol in your blood.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Bhatnagar D, Soran H, Durrington PN.

Trans fats are found in food such as hard margarine, full-fat margarine, fast food, and baked goods (doughnuts, pastries, biscuits).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Your genes</strong>: Some people seem to be able to eat lots of fatty food without getting high levels of cholesterol in their blood. But other people have to be very careful about what they eat. This difference may be caused by differences in their genes (the basic material in all cells that controls how cells grow and behave). Differences in genes may affect how much cholesterol your body makes and how it handles the fat in the food you eat.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of exercise</strong>: People who don't take regular exercise tend to have lower levels of good (HDL) cholesterol. Exercising more can raise HDL cholesterol.</li>

<li><strong>Getting older</strong>: Cholesterol tends to rise as we get older. For women, cholesterol is particularly likely to rise around the menopause.</li>

            <dd class="further-info-tab-content" role="tabpanel" id="content-1319-5" aria-describedby="title-1319-5">
                <div data-cms-content-id="273_1_further-info_1319"><p>The only way to find out whether you have high cholesterol is to have a blood test.</p>
<p>When doctors take a blood sample to check cholesterol, they don't just measure the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. They usually also measure the different types of cholesterol in your blood. This is called a lipid profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lipid profile gives you five readings, or numbers. The levels of lipids in your blood are usually measured in millimoles per litre of blood, or mmol/L for short. You might also see lipid levels described in milligrams per decilitre of blood, or mg/dL for short. (This may sound complicated, but the final numbers are much simpler.)</p>
<p>These numbers show your levels of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total cholesterol</strong>. This is the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including both good and bad cholesterol.</li>
<li><strong>LDL cholesterol</strong>. This is the 'bad' cholesterol that can clog up your arteries.</li>
<li><strong>HDL cholesterol</strong>. This is the 'good' cholesterol that picks up extra cholesterol, preventing it from building up in your arteries.</li>
<li><strong>Total cholesterol to HDL ratio</strong>. This is the balance between your overall cholesterol and your good (HDL) cholesterol.</li>
<li><strong>Triglycerides</strong>. These are another type of fat in the blood. High levels of triglycerides can be harmful. Many people who have too much 'bad' cholesterol in their blood also have high levels of triglycerides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood lipids can vary from day to day, and from test to test, so your doctor will do at least two blood tests before recommending treatment for high cholesterol. As a rough guide, doctors often say a person&rsquo;s cholesterol is high if:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Their total cholesterol is <strong>5.0 mmol/L or above</strong></li>
<li>Their LDL cholesterol is <strong>3.0 mmol/L or above</strong></li>
<li>Their total cholesterol to HDL ratio is <strong>6 or above</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these numbers alone can't say whether your cholesterol is likely to cause you health problems. People with the same cholesterol levels can have very different chances of having heart and circulation problems.</p>
<p>For example, someone with a LDL cholesterol level of 3.0 mmol/L who smokes and has high blood pressure is likely to be offered treatment for high cholesterol. On the other hand, someone with the same cholesterol level might not need treatment if they don&rsquo;t smoke and their blood pressure is normal.</p>
<p>Your doctor will look at several factors to work out your overall chance of heart and circulation problems. These may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your age</li>
<li>Your ethnicity - for example, south Asian people may have a greater chance of heart and circulation problems[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-15">15</span>]<span id="reference-15" class="content-reference">Chaturvedi N. Ethnic Differences in Cardiovascular Disease. Heart. 2003; 89: 681-686.</span></li>
<li>Whether you smoke</li>
<li>Whether your mother, father, or a sibling had a heart attack or angina (a type of chest pain) before the age of 60</li>
<li>Whether you have certain conditions, such as long-term (chronic) kidney disease,&nbsp; rheumatoid arthritis, or <span class="st">lupus</span></li>
<li>Whether you are being treated for high blood pressure</li>
<li>Whether you are overweight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will enter this information into a calculator to estimate your chance of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. One example is the Qrisk calculator, which was created specifically for people in the UK. You can work out your own risk on the Qrisk site (<a href="http://www.qrisk.org">http://www.qrisk.org</a>).</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/high-cholesterol-pressure/20-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a> risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years, you are considered at high risk.

                <div data-cms-content-id="273_1_further-info_1322"><p>We can&rsquo;t say for certain what will happen if you have high cholesterol. This depends on several things, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How high your cholesterol is</li>
<li>How long it has been high, and</li>
<li>Whether you have other health problems that increase your chance of heart and circulation problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do know that you have a better chance of staying healthy if your cholesterol is kept low.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span> This is because people who have high cholesterol are more likely to get <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>, which is also known as hardening of the arteries.</p>
<p>If you have atherosclerosis, fatty deposits called <strong>plaques</strong> build up inside your arteries. This can make them narrower and restrict blood flow, which can cause problems throughout the body. The most serious of these problems are <strong>heart attacks</strong> and <strong>strokes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have narrowed arteries in your heart, this can cause chest pain and pressure (<strong>angina</strong>). If a blockage is severe, it can cause a <strong>heart attack</strong>.</li>
<li>If arteries leading to your brain are narrowed, you may get temporary numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking, and other signs of a <strong>transient ischaemic attack</strong> (TIA), which is also called a mini-stroke. If a TIA is left untreated or a blockage is more severe, this can cause a <strong>stroke</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you have narrowed arteries in your arms and legs, you can get aching pain, tingling, or numbness in your limbs. This is called <strong>peripheral arterial disease</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have narrowed arteries leading to your kidneys, this can cause <strong>high blood pressure</strong> and <strong>kidney failure</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have narrowed arteries in your genitals, this can lead to <strong>difficulties with sex</strong>. Less blood flow to a woman&rsquo;s vagina can make sex less enjoyable. Less blood flow to a man&rsquo;s penis can cause erection problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plaques can also suddenly <strong>break open </strong>(rupture). This forms a blood clot which can rapidly block an artery, causing sudden symptoms and potentially resulting in a heart attack or stroke. This can happen even if someone has no symptoms of narrowed arteries and otherwise seems healthy. The longer someone has cholesterol that is too high, the more plaques they are likely to develop. And the more plaques someone has, the higher the chance that one will rupture.</p>
<p>Having treatment to lower your cholesterol can reduce your chance of these problems. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every 10 percent (one tenth) drop in total cholesterol, your chance of heart problems drops by 25 percent (one quarter) after five years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="273_2_further-info_1329_0"><p>Lifestyle changes to reduce cholesterol are things that people can do to help bring down their cholesterol and lower their chance of heart and circulation problems.</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing your diet</li>
<li>Taking regular exercise</li>
<li>Stopping smoking (if you smoke).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changing your diet</strong></p>
<p>The amount of fat you eat can affect your cholesterol levels. This doesn't mean that all fat is bad. You just need to be careful about the types of fat you eat.</p>
<p>The less-healthy kinds of fat are called <strong>saturated fats</strong> and <strong>trans fats</strong>. Saturated fats are found in meat and dairy products. Trans fats are found in some fast foods, biscuits, and baked goods. In general, less-healthy types of fat are solid at room temperature. Healthier types tend to be liquids, like olive oil and vegetable oil. These healthier types of fat are called <strong>polyunsaturated</strong> or <strong>monounsaturated</strong> fats.</p>
<p>A healthy, low-fat diet involves eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, lean cuts of meat and poultry, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. Doctors also recommend eating at least two portions of fish a week, including at least one portion of oily fish (such as salmon, herring, sardines, or mackerel). It's best to avoid sugary soft drinks, sweets, and baked goods, and to drink alcohol only in moderation. Drinking high amounts of alcohol on a regular basis can increase&nbsp; cholesterol.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span></p>
<p>It's also important to choose healthy ways of cooking food. For example, frying food in butter or ghee increases the amount of less-healthy fat in your diet. Steaming, poaching, baking, or microwaving food lowers these fat levels. Instead of flavouring food with sauces that are buttery, creamy, or cheesy, you might consider using spices, herbs, or lemon juice.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p><strong>Taking regular exercise</strong></p>
<p>This means getting a moderate amount of exercise on most days. Types of exercise include walking briskly, swimming, walking stairs, or cycling. Some household tasks also count as exercise, including vacuuming, and using a power mower.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Lipid modification. May 2008. Clinical guideline 67. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/cg67 (accessed on 7 January 2013).</span></p>
<p>Doctors recommend that most people exercise at a moderate intensity for 30 minutes, at least five days a week.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Lipid modification. May 2008. Clinical guideline 67. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/cg67 (accessed on 7 January 2013).</span> 'Moderate intensity' means exercising hard enough to raise your heart rate and breathing, and break a sweat. As a guide, you should be able to talk during moderate-intensity exercise, but not sing.&nbsp;<span class="content-reference"><br /></span></p>
<p>It's not necessary to do the 30 minutes all at one time. It can be broken into bouts of physical activity of at least 10 minutes each.</p>
<p>People who have not exercised for some time can get advice about what exercise will suit them best from their GP, a nurse, or an exercise specialist. Some people may be reluctant to exercise due to health problems. Their doctor can provide advice on what types of exercise might be best for them, how much they should do, and for how long.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stopping smoking</strong></p>
<p>Stopping smoking means giving up cigarettes and other forms of smoking tobacco completely. There are lots of things that can help you stop smoking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting professional help from your doctor, a nurse, or a trained counsellor</li>
<li>Joining a self-help group with other people trying to stop smoking</li>
<li>Using nicotine replacement products like patches, nasal sprays, or gum. These products help you crave cigarettes less by giving your body some nicotine. Nicotine is the chemical in cigarettes that makes them addictive.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Asking your doctor about anti-smoking drugs, such as bupropion (brand name Zyban) and varenicline (Champix).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to stop smoking, your GP can provide support and advice, treatments, and a referral to an intensive support service, such as the NHS Stop Smoking Services. The NHS also offers a free smoking helpline. The number is 0800 022 4 332.</p></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about the ways different lifestyle changes can help if you have high cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>Changing your diet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eating less saturated fat can lower your cholesterol. Your doctor will discuss what cholesterol levels are best for you. As a rough guide, doctors say total cholesterol should be below 5.0 mmol/L.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span> In one group of people, changing their diet reduced their total cholesterol level by an average of 0.33 mmol/L.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-28">28</span>]<span id="reference-28" class="content-reference">Hooper L, Summerbell CD, Thompson R, et al. Reduced or modified dietary fat for preventing cardiovascular disease (Cochrane review). In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span> Most people had been eating less saturated fat for at least two years.</li>
<li>Eating less saturated fat can lower your risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or other heart and circulation problems. In the same group of people, <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/high-cholesterol-pressure/66-in-1000.jpg" class="image-reference">66 in 1,000</a> people who ate less saturated fat had one of these problems, compared with <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/high-cholesterol-pressure/77-in-1000.jpg" class="image-reference">77 in 1,000</a> who did not change their diet.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-28">28</span>]<span id="reference-28" class="content-reference">Hooper L, Summerbell CD, Thompson R, et al. Reduced or modified dietary fat for preventing cardiovascular disease (Cochrane review). In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Taking regular exercise</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking regular exercise can improve your level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span> In one group of people who exercised at a moderate intensity for at least three weeks, their HDL cholesterol increased by 10 percent, on average. Doing more vigorous exercise may improve cholesterol more than exercising at a more moderate level.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Tambalis K, Panagiotakos DB, Kavouras SA, et al. Responses of blood lipids to aerobic, resistance, and combined aerobic with resistance exercise training: a systematic review of current evidence. Angiology. 2009; 60: 614-632.</span></li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t know how improving your cholesterol through regular exercise might lower your risk of heart and circulation problems. Not much research has looked at this. We do know that taking regular exercise has many other health benefits, including helping you achieve and maintain a healthy weight, lowering your blood pressure, and reducing your risk of diabetes. All these things lower your chance of having a heart attack, stroke, and other heart and circulation problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association. JBS 2: Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. Heart. 2005; 91 (supplement 5): S1-S52.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stopping smoking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People who smoke have lower levels of good (HDL) cholesterol. Stopping smoking can improve these levels.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-33">33</span>]<span id="reference-33" class="content-reference">Gepner AD, Piper ME, Johnson HM, et al. Effects of smoking and smoking cessation on lipids and lipoproteins: outcomes from a randomized clinical trial. American Heart Journal. 2011; 161: 145-151.</span></li>
<li>Smoking is a major cause of serious heart and circulation problems, such as heart attacks and strokes. By stopping smoking, you reduce your chance of these problems. Ten years after stopping, your chance of having these problems is the same as for someone who never smoked.<span class="content-reference">[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association.

<ul>
<li><strong>Statins</strong>. Statins are the main drug treatment for high cholesterol. They work mainly by lowering levels of 'bad' (LDL) cholesterol. Commonly prescribed statins (and their brand names) are atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), pravastatin (Lipostat), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor).&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fibrates</strong>. These drugs help mainly by raising the level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol and lowering the level of triglycerides. Triglycerides are another type of harmful fat in the blood. Some examples of fibrates (with brand names) are fenofibrate (Lipantil, Supralip) and gemfibrozil (Lopid).</li>
<li><strong>Absorption inhibitors</strong>. These drugs lower 'bad' (LDL) cholesterol levels in the blood by stopping the absorption of cholesterol in the gut. The only absorption inhibitor available at the moment is called ezetimibe (brand name Ezetrol).</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctors usually prescribe a statin first, as these drugs work well for most people. If your cholesterol is still too high while taking a statin, your doctor may suggest that you increase your dose or recommend taking an absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) as well.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about how each type of drug can help.</p>
<p><strong>Statins</strong><br />Statins can improve cholesterol levels, mainly by lowering the level of bad (LDL) cholesterol. Your doctor will discuss what cholesterol levels are best for you. As a rough guide, doctors say total cholesterol should be below 5.0 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol should be below 3.0 mmol/L.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association.

<p>We don't know whether taking a statin will help you live longer.

<p><strong>Fibrates</strong><br />Fibrates raise good (HDL) cholesterol and lower bad fats called triglycerides. They also lower LDL cholesterol, but not as much as statins do.</p>
<p>People who take fibrates have a lower chance of heart and circulation problems, including heart attacks.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-48">48</span>]<span id="reference-48" class="content-reference">Jun M, Foote C, Lv J, et al.

<ul>
<li>In one group of people who took ezetimibe, their average LDL cholesterol dropped by about one fifth after 12 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ezetimibe is a fairly new drug. There is not much research looking at how well it works long term and whether it can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other heart and circulation problems. Other research suggests that, in general, every 10 percent (one tenth) drop in total cholesterol reduces the risk of heart problems by 25 percent (one quarter) after five years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-10">10</span>]<span id="reference-10" class="content-reference">British Cardiac Society; British Hypertension Society; Diabetes UK; HEART UK; Primary Care Cardiovascular Society; Stroke Association.

The chance of side effects can be reduced if people take a lower dose or a weaker statin.<span class="content-reference"><br /></span></p>
<p>Possible side effects from statins include:</p>
<p><strong>Muscle pain, weakness, or damage</strong>. Some people report muscle aches and pain (myalgia) or muscle weakness (myopathy) while taking statins. This isn&rsquo;t always caused by the statin, as people taking a dummy (placebo) treatment in studies also report these problems. Often these symptoms go away, but they can be a sign of muscle damage.</p>
<p>Some people taking statins get a type of severe muscle damage called rhabdomyolysis. If this happens, muscle tissue breaks down into chemicals that enter the bloodstream. These chemicals are harmful to the kidneys. Rhabdomyolysis is rare. In a year, around 3 in every 100,000 people taking a statin will be diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-55">55</span>]<span id="reference-55" class="content-reference">Law M, Rudnicka AR.

<p><strong>Omega 3 fish oil</strong></p>
<p>This is a type of polyunsaturated fat that may help protect against heart and circulation problems. There are two ways to get more omega 3 fish oil in your diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can eat more oily fish, such as herring, mackerel, sardines, salmon, pilchards, and trout. Most people are advised to eat no more than four portions a week. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or may become pregnant are advised to eat no more than two portions.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-68">68</span>]<span id="reference-68" class="content-reference">NHS choices.

<li>You can take fish oils in capsules. You don't need a prescription to get these. Your doctor can advise you on how much to take.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plant stanols and sterols</strong></p>
<p>These are natural substances found in plants that are similar to human cholesterol. They help lower cholesterol by stopping it from being absorbed in the gut.</p>
<p>Natural sources of sterols and stanols include wheat germ oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sesame seeds, nuts, and some fruits such as oranges and figs. The amount in these foods is too small to have much effect on cholesterol. So treatment with stanols and sterols involves eating foods enriched with higher amounts of these substances. These may include enriched margarines, yoghurts, fruit juices, and cereal bars. If you&rsquo;re taking stanols and sterols as supplements, you will probably need about 2 to 3 grams of these substances a day.</p></div>

<p>In one group of people taking an average of 2 grams of these supplements a day for three weeks to a year, total cholesterol dropped by 0.36 mmol/L, on average, and LDL cholesterol dropped by 0.35 mmol/L.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-75">75</span>]<span id="reference-75" class="content-reference">Wu T, Fu J, Yang Y, et al.

<p>Plant stanols and sterols don&rsquo;t seem to have much effect on levels of good (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-75">75</span>]<span id="reference-75" class="content-reference">Wu T, Fu J, Yang Y, et al.

<p>We don&rsquo;t know if lowering cholesterol with plant stanols and sterols will reduce the risk of heart and circulation problems.
