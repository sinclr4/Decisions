<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Women can also get inguinal hernias. Inguinal hernias are less common and often smaller in women.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open surgery, where a single cut is made in the groin area. When the hernia is found, the hole can be either stitched closed or covered and closed with a thin sheet of material called a mesh. Mesh operations are now the most common. With time the mesh becomes part of the muscle layer, resulting in a very strong permanent repair.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Keyhole&rsquo; surgery (laparoscopy), where a few small incisions are made in the abdomen. A small telescopic camera called a laparoscope is then inserted to give the surgeon a close-up view of the hernia and surrounding tissues. Special instruments are then used to repair the hernia, normally using a mesh.&nbsp;</li>

<li>totally extra-peritoneal (TEP), where the operation takes place in the space between the muscles and the lining of the abdomen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open repair of inguinal hernia can be carried out under local or general anaesthetic. Some research has suggested that there is a quicker recovery after laparoscopic surgery, however the accuracy of these studies is questionable and we don't really know if there is a difference between the open and laparoscopic procedures.
