                <div data-cms-content-id="81_1_further-info_348"><p>The part of your body that makes and gets rid of urine is called your urinary tract. It includes your kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Your kidneys filter water and waste products out of your blood to make urine.</p>
<p>Urine drains from your kidneys down tubes called <strong>ureters</strong>. Most people have two ureters, one for each kidney. Both ureters empty into your bladder. Urine is stored in your bladder until you go to the toilet. When you urinate, urine passes out of your body from the bladder through a tube called the <strong>urethra</strong>. Together, the bladder and the urethra make up the <strong>lower urinary tract</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men have a gland called the prostate gland at the base of the&nbsp;bladder. (Glands make substances that are used somewhere else in the body.) Only men have a prostate, which is about the size of a walnut. The front of your prostate is wrapped around your <strong>urethra</strong><strong>. </strong>The prostate helps make the milky fluid that comes out of your penis when you ejaculate. The fluid from your prostate helps keep your sperm healthy and helps them swim.</p>
<p>The back of your prostate presses against your back passage (rectum). This is why your doctor examines your rectum if there's a problem with your prostate. He or she can feel the gland through the wall of your rectum.</p>
<p>The <strong>two bundles of nerves</strong> that control your erections run on either side of your prostate.</p>
<p>Your prostate is also linked to your <strong>testicles</strong>. These are the two organs that make sperm and the male hormone testosterone. They lie in a pouch of skin on either side of your penis. Your sperm are carried by tubes that run from your testicles and through your prostate into your urethra. Your prostate adds its fluid to the sperm when they reach your urethra.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Barry MJ, Fowler FJ Jr, O'Leary MP, et al.&nbsp;The American Urological Association symptom index for benign prostatic hyperplasia.&nbsp;<span>Journal of Urology. 1992; 148: 1549-1557.</span></span></p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="81_1_further-info_349"><p>There are two main types of lower urinary tract symptoms. Doctors call them&nbsp;voiding symptoms and storage symptoms. Voiding symptoms happen while you are urinating. Storage symptoms affect how well your bladder stores urine.</p>
<p>Voiding symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>having to wait before you start urinating</li>
<li>stopping and starting when urinating</li>
<li>having to push or strain to urinate</li>
<li>having a weak flow or weak stream of urine</li>
<li>dribbling at the end of passing urine</li>
<li>feeling as if your bladder is never quite empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storage symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>having to urinate more often than you used to</li>
<li>finding it difficult to wait before urinating</li>
<li>having to get up at night to urinate</li>
<li>being suddenly desperate to urinate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone gets all of these symptoms. Not everyone who has symptoms finds them troublesome.</p>
<p>Your doctor may use a questionnaire to measure your symptoms. One of the most common questionnaires is called the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.</p>
<p>This questionnaire has seven questions that ask you to rate how severe your symptoms are.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Barry MJ, Fowler FJ Jr, O'Leary MP, et al.&nbsp;The American Urological Association symptom index for benign prostatic hyperplasia.&nbsp;<span>Journal of Urology. 1992; 148: 1549-1557.</span></span>&nbsp;Your answers are used to calculate your symptom score. There is also an eighth question about how your symptoms affect your life.</p>
<p>The questionnaire is used to work out whether your symptoms are mild, moderate, or severe. This may affect the treatments you are offered.</p></div>

<p>It can be hard to tell which one is causing your symptoms, because the symptoms can be similar. Some men with an enlarged prostate have no symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Enlarged prostate</strong></p>
<p>As you get older, your prostate may get bigger. You may hear it called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This condition is not cancer. An enlarged prostate can cause problems by pressing on the urethra and restricting the flow of urine.</p>
<p>Having an enlarged prostate is more common among older men than younger men.

<p>Lower urinary tract symptoms in men can be caused by an overactive bladder. When your bladder is working normally, you start to feel the need to urinate when it&rsquo;s about half full. You don&rsquo;t need to use the toilet straight away, and you can hold on for a while. When you have an overactive bladder, the bladder will contract when it contains only a small amount of urine, so that your bladder feels fuller than it is.</p>
<p>Overactive bladder may be caused by changes in your prostate.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-4">4</span>]<span id="reference-4" class="content-reference">McConnell J. Epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. In: Campbell MF, Walsh PC, Retik AB (editors). Campbell's Urology. 8th edition. WB Saunders, Philadelphia, PA; 2002.</span> For example, the wall of your bladder may become thick and irritable because the prostate has grown and is pressing against it. This can make the bladder overactive.</p>

You are likely to have some tests, to see how severe your symptoms are, and what might be causing them. If you are deciding about treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms, you will probably have had some of the tests listed below. There is no one test that can show whether your symptoms are caused by an enlarged prostate, or by an overactive bladder.</p>
<p>Your doctor might start by ruling out cancer. With a digital rectal examination, he or she can feel your prostate for abnormalities, which might be a sign of prostate cancer. A blood test called a Prostate Specific Antigen test can help tell if you have an increased risk of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Your doctor will ask about your health, past illnesses, operations, or treatments you have had (your medical history), and about any medicines you are taking. Medicines can affect the way your bladder works.</p>
<p>Several tests measure how&nbsp;quickly and how strongly you are urinating, and whether there is any urine left in your bladder when you finish urinating.</p>
<p>Your doctor might test your blood or urine to check for infection, bladder cancer, diabetes, or kidney problems. Scans such as ultrasound can give your doctor a picture of your prostate and the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="p">Your doctor may&nbsp;ask you to complete a urinary frequency volume chart. This means that you keep a record of how often you urinate, and at what time of day or night. You measure how much urine you produce each time you urinate. This is the most accurate way of recording how much and when you urinate.</p>

<p class="TableContents">Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and bladder training may, over time, help you need to urinate less often.

<p>Your doctor may advise you to take more than one drug for your symptoms, because different drugs treat different symptoms.&nbsp;There are three main types of drugs to treat lower urinary tract symptoms:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha blockers</strong></p>
<p>These are used for moderate and severe problems with urinating, for men where it's likely symptoms are caused by an enlarged prostate. They make the muscles around the prostate and the bladder relax. This makes it easier to urinate. They can also be used, along with catheterisation, to treat acute urinary retention (when you suddenly can&rsquo;t pass urine at all). There are several different alpha blockers: alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin.</p>
<p><strong>5-alpha-reductase inhibitors</strong></p>
<p>These drugs are used to shrink the size of the prostate gland or to stop it getting larger. The drugs of this type used to treat an enlarged prostate are dutasteride and finasteride.</p>
<p><strong>Antimuscarinics</strong></p>
<p>You might also hear these drugs called anticholinergics. They are used to treat an overactive bladder. These drugs relax the bladder so it takes longer before you feel like your bladder is full. Several antimuscarinic drugs are used including tolterodine and oxybutynin.</p>
<p>Some men try over-the-counter treatments, such as saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). This is a plant extract made from the American dwarf palm tree. This plant has been used for hundreds of years by Native Americans, both as a food and to treat sexual and prostate problems, but we are not sure how it works.</p></div>

<p>Your doctor needs to be sure that the drugs are suitable for the type of symptoms you have. If your symptoms suggest you have an overactive bladder, you may need antimuscarinic drugs. If your symptoms suggest you have an enlarged prostate that is pressing on your urethra, you may need alpha blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can buy an alpha blocker called tamsulosin over the counter. The pharmacist will ask you questions to check whether the drug is right for you. You will need to see a doctor if you want to take this treatment for more than a few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)</strong></p>
<p>5-ARIs may help with problems while urinating. They are not a cure. These drugs work by shrinking your prostate, which may relieve pressure on your urethra. They are usually taken by men with mild or moderate symptoms.&nbsp;They take several months to start working. Finasteride may take six months to show an improvement. Dutasteride may take three months.&nbsp;They may help reduce symptoms for about three years. After that time they don&rsquo;t work as well.</p>
<p>In groups of men who took 5-ARIs, symptom scores improved by about 0.8 points after one year and 1.8 points after two years, on&nbsp;a scale of 0 to 35 points.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Antimuscarinics</strong></p>
<p>Antimuscarinics (sometimes called anticholinergics) may help with symptoms of an overactive bladder. They work by making the bladder contract less often.</p>
<p>In a group of men who took an antimuscarinic, episodes of urgency incontinence (when you suddenly need to urinate and can&rsquo;t wait) were reduced by about half after three months.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-13">13</span>]<span id="reference-13" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p><strong>Transurethral resection of the prostate</strong> (TURP) involves cutting away part of the prostate gland to stop it pressing on the urethra. A surgeon puts a thin tube into the opening of the penis and up the urethra to the prostate. The tube has a light and a small camera on the end. It also has a tiny loop attached to it. The loop is heated with an electric current and used to cut away the part of the prostate that is blocking the urethra. The pieces of prostate are flushed down the tube with water. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into the urethra to drain away urine after the operation.</p>
<p><span>This operation can also be done using a slightly different instrument with two electrodes. This is called bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate.&nbsp;</span>The results are the same as for TURP.</p>
<p><strong>Transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate</strong> (HoLEP) is a type of surgery that uses a laser, which produces intense heat in a small area. A small laser is put into the opening in your penis and up your urethra. The laser cuts away the overgrown parts of the prostate that are blocking the urethra by peeling them away from the prostate's outer lining. This is is a bit like peeling an orange from the inside.</p>
<p>Lasers are also used to destroy part of the prostate in other, similar operations. These are not used routinely on the NHS because there is not enough evidence about how well they work.</p>
<p>Cystoplasty is a major operation used to treat an overactive bladder in men with severe problems holding urine. This operation is used to make the bladder bigger using a part of your bowel, so that you can hold more urine. It is only used if other treatments have not worked.</p></div>
