</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>

When you get cancer, your cells grow and multiply too quickly. In lung cancer, abnormal cells group together to form a lump called a tumour. This gets bigger over time. The speed at which it grows varies from one person to another.</p>
<p>Nearly all types of lung cancer can spread to other parts of your body and form more tumours. These are called secondary tumours, secondaries, or metastases.</p>
<p>The most common kind of lung cancer is non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 90 in 100 cases of lung cancer are this type. It can start in different parts of the lung. There are three different types of non-small-cell cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adenocarcinoma: this kind of cancer usually starts in the airways at the outer areas of the lungs. It is the most common type of non-small-cell lung cancer.</li>
<li>Squamous cell carcinoma: this is a cancer that often affects the larger airways.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Large cell carcinoma: this type of cancer is less common and is made up of larger cells than other forms of lung cancer.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">Cancer Research UK.&nbsp;Types of lung cancer.

They are like two spongy, elastic bags that fill up with air as you breathe in, and empty as you breathe out. The right lung is divided into three sections, and the left lung into two sections. These sections are called lobes.</p>
<p>Keeping your lungs healthy is important. They take oxygen from the air you breathe, and your blood carries this oxygen around your body. When you breathe out, your lungs get rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product made by your body.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="108_1_further-info_638"><p>Doctors describe the stage a cancer has reached by looking at three important factors. It is called the TNM system: T is for Tumour, N is for lymph Nodes (the first place a cancer usually spreads to), and M is for Metastasis (when the cancer spreads to other parts of your body outside of the lung). Each factor is given a number. Generally, lower numbers mean your cancer is less advanced.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Cancer Research UK. Lung cancer stages. March 2011. Available at: http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/lung-cancer/treatment/lung-cancer-staging&nbsp;(accessed on 12 September 2012).</span></p>
<p>This decision aid is for people with localised lung cancer.</p>
<p>Doctors use these TNM factors to group cancers into numbered stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stages 1 and 2: the cancer is limited to one area of the lung. It may have reached the closest lymph nodes. This is called localised cancer.</li>
<li>Stage 3: the cancer is larger and may have grown into the surrounding tissues. There may be cancer cells in the lymph nodes further away from the lung (in the middle of the chest or base of the neck). This is called locally advanced cancer.</li>
<li>Stage 4: the cancer has spread to another part of the body. This is called secondary or metastatic cancer.</li>

<p>In people who do have symptoms, the most common are coughing and breathing problems. Although your symptoms may start off seeming like a cold or flu, if you have lung cancer they won't get better. They won't be cured by remedies you can buy at a pharmacy or get from your GP. Other symptoms include coughing up blood, pain, and losing weight without trying.</p>
<p>While most lung cancers are caused by tobacco smoking, people who've never smoked can also get lung cancer. So it's important to get symptoms checked out, even if you're a life-long non-smoker.</p></div>

Men who smoke are 22 times more likely to die from lung cancer than those who don't smoke. Women who smoke are 12 times more likely to die from lung cancer than those who don't smoke. It can take many years for the cancer to develop. Sometimes people who have never smoked also get lung cancer. P<span lang="EN-US">assive smoking, when you do not smoke but people near you do, is now known to increase the risk of lung cancer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Some materials used in industry can give you a greater chance of getting lung cancer. These include asbestos and other chemicals that can cause lung cancer, such as arsenic and chromium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other possible factors that can increase the risk of lung cancer include air pollution, having another lung disease, and exposure to radon.</p>
<p>Radon is an invisible gas that has no taste or smell, and is found naturally in soil and rocks. Buildings on land that contains a lot of radon tend to include high levels. In the UK, these areas are Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Northamptonshire, and Derbyshire.</p></div>

<p>Doctors will ask you questions and do some tests to diagnose lung cancer. Your doctor may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask you about your symptoms</li>
<li>Listen to your breathing through a stethoscope</li>
<li>Refer you to your local hospital for a chest x-ray or CT scan</li>
<li>Refer you to a hospital specialist.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-3">3</span>]<span id="reference-3" class="content-reference">Cancer Research UK. Lung cancer tests. March 2011.

</ul>
<p>A chest x-ray takes pictures of your lungs to see if there are any signs of lung cancer or another illness. Your doctor will refer you for an urgent x-ray if you have symptoms, such as coughing up blood, that could possibly indicate lung cancer. Your doctor may also refer you for an x-ray if you have other symptoms, such as a simple cough, especially if they have gone on for more than three weeks. The results of the chest x-ray will help the doctor decide whether you need to see a specialist.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-4">4</span>]<span id="reference-4" class="content-reference">NHS Choices.&nbsp;X-ray. Available at: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/X-ray/Pages/Introduction.aspx&nbsp;(accessed on 12 September 2012).</span>&nbsp;If the x-ray or your symptoms show signs of lung cancer, you should be offered an urgent appointment with a hospital specialist. A small number of people with lung cancer have a normal chest x-ray so your doctor may refer you for further tests anyway.</p>
<p>Your specialist may arrange for some more tests. The most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CT scan</strong>: a special type of x-ray using a computer to get a more detailed picture of your lungs.</li>
<li><strong>PET-CT scan</strong>: uses injections of tiny amounts of radioactive chemicals to show what's happening in your body. Cancers show up as very active because they contain lots of cells dividing.</li>
<li><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong>: a flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end (bronchoscope) is passed down through your nose or mouth into your lungs. This lets your doctor examine and remove small samples of cells (biopsies) from inside your lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Needle biopsy of the lung</strong>: samples taken of cells that are then looked at in a laboratory to find out whether you have cancer, and if so what type.</li>

Lung cancer is also the leading cause of death from cancer in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 41,400 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK and more than 35,000 people die from it. More British people die from lung cancer each year than from breast and bowel cancers combined.</p>
<p>Lung cancer is becoming less common in men, since a peak in the early 1980s. And figures in women are levelling off, though they aren't going down yet. This is probably because fewer people are smoking.</p>
<p>However, a study of people born since 1950 shows trends like this can change quite quickly. Researchers found that among people in their 20s and 30s, there were small increases in the number dying from lung cancer. They suggest this may be due to the known rise in smoking among teenagers.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">Macmillan Cancer Support.

<p>Without treatment, lung cancer is likely to spread.</p>
<p>Many people with lung cancer are diagnosed only when the disease is advanced and it has already spread either to tissues nearby or to more distant parts of the body. If you have been diagnosed when your cancer is still within the lung, your chances of living longer are better.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Cancer Research UK.&nbsp;Statistics and outlook for lung cancer. March 2011. Available at: http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/lung-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-lung-cancer (accessed on 12 September 2012).</span></p>
<p>The outlook for people with lung cancer is better than it used to be. For people with non-small-cell lung cancer that has not spread outside the lung, more than half are likely to be alive five years after being diagnosed. Even people with more advanced lung cancer may&nbsp;live for at least a year after being diagnosed. A number of people live for a normal life-span after being diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment options</strong></p>
<p><strong>Active monitoring</strong>: you do not have immediate treatment. Instead, you are regularly checked to monitor the growth of the tumour and in case you get symptoms or any symptoms you already have get worse. This approach may be used if the treatments available are risky for you, or if the diagnosis of lung cancer is not certain. If your symptoms do get worse, your doctor may recommend treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Radical radiotherapy</strong>: your doctor may suggest that you have an intensive course of radiotherapy, to try to destroy the cancer cells. This is called radical radiotherapy. It is sometimes offered to people who have illnesses such as heart or other lung disease, because the risk of having surgery is higher for them. One other alternative is radiofrequency ablation (the use of heat to destroy cancerous tissue) but this is not often used. It is not a type of radiotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery</strong>: if you have a small tumour that hasn't spread, you'll probably be offered surgery to remove it. This is likely to give you the best chance of living longer.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery with or without chemotherapy</strong>: doctors may offer you treatment with anti-cancer drugs (adjuvant chemotherapy) after an operation if you have lung cancer at certain early stages, and depending on the size of the tumour. Depending on your stage of cancer, the combination of surgery followed with chemotherapy may help you live longer.</p>

<p>Standard radiation therapy usually involves visiting the hospital or clinic on a daily (outpatient) basis for about four to six weeks.</p>
<p>Another type of radiotherapy is known as CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy). CHART uses smaller doses of radiation than standard radiotherapy, but treatment is given three times a day over about two weeks.

<p>Some people have more intensive radiotherapy, using high-dose radiation, targeted very precisely to the part of the body affected by the cancer. This is called stereotactic radiotherapy.

<p>It is quite common to get a cough during or after radiotherapy for lung cancer.</p>
<p>You may lose hair on your chest&nbsp;during radiotherapy. Sometimes hair loss after radiotherapy is permanent. You will not lose any hair from your head.</p>
<p>Radiotherapy does not hurt, but some people get chest pain within 24 hours of having the treatment. It will go away by itself.</p>

<p>There are three main types of operation that can be used to remove a tumour from the lungs.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small part of the lung is removed. This is a&nbsp;<strong>wedge resection</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>segmentectomy</strong>. This type of operation isn't done very often.</li>
<li>One lobe of the lung is removed. This is called a&nbsp;<strong>lobectomy</strong>. This is the most common type of operation. When two lobes are removed it's called a&nbsp;<strong>bilobectomy</strong>.</li>
<li>The whole lung is removed. This is called a&nbsp;<strong>pneumonectomy</strong>. This is done if your doctor thinks that some cancer cells have spread to another part of the lung.</li>
<li>Some types of lung cancer operations are done using a type of keyhole surgery called video-assisted thorascopic surgery. You might hear this be called VATS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have chemotherapy after surgery, if their cancer is at a stage where chemotherapy may help. In a few cases, your doctor might suggest chemotherapy before surgery to try to shrink the tumour. Not everyone with localised lung cancer needs to have chemotherapy. Your doctor will discuss whether it might be helpful for you.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill cancer cells. They are usually given as injections into your vein or as a drip (also called an IV or an&nbsp;intravenous infusion). Some come as tablets. You usually have to go to hospital to have injections and drips, as an outpatient.</p></div>

<p>Some patients cannot have surgery because removing the cancerous part of the lung wouldn't leave them with enough remaining lung to breathe well enough. You might hear this called 'lung capacity'. Other reasons why you might not be fit enough to have surgery include heart problems, or having health too poor to withstand a major operation.</p>
<p>Not everyone with localised lung cancer needs to have chemotherapy. It depends if their tumour is at the right stage for chemotherapy to be helpful, and whether they want to have chemotherapy. Your doctor will discuss whether it might be helpful for you.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Most people feel breathless and have pain after surgery for lung cancer. It is a major operation and involves opening up the rib cage.</p>
<p>Your health care team can prescribe medicines called painkillers to help control pain after surgery. These can be taken as tablets or given through a vein in your arm (as a drip). Some people will continue to feel pain for a few years after surgery.</p>
<p>Breathlessness can be caused by fluid around the lung, in an area called the pleural space. Breathlessness affects about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Lung-Cancer/25-100.jpg" class="image-reference">25 in 100</a> people after surgery.

<p>The operation can also cause heart problems. The heart may beat too fast, too slowly, or erratically. This happens to between <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Lung-Cancer/13-in-100-and-27-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">13 and 27 in 100</a> people.

<p>Another problem after surgery is infection of the wound site. This can be serious and can cause death, but this is very rare.</p>
<p>Other side effects include difficulty in swallowing and feeling sick, which are usually short term.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chemotherapy side effects</strong></p>
<p>Different types of chemotherapy can cause different side effects. Your specialist can tell you more about the specific side effects that might be caused by each type of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Feeling sick is a very common side effect of chemotherapy. Your doctor can prescribe medicines called anti-emetics to help with this. Another side effect of chemotherapy can be anaemia (reduction of red blood cells and white blood cells). This can make you weak, tired, and prone to infection. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for signs of infection.</p>
<p>Other side effects include hair loss, constipation, and diarrhoea. You might feel tingling in your fingers and toes. Chemotherapy may also make you feel very tired.</p></div>
