            <div class="col left-col"><p>Our Decision Support telephone service is here to&nbsp;assist and guide you through the Shared Decision Making process.</p>
<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Hours Of Operation</p>
<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

<p><strong>The hormonal coil</strong></p>
<p>The hormonal coil is a small plastic device that is fitted inside the womb where it slowly releases a hormone called progestogen. This stops the lining of the womb from getting thicker. The hormonal coil also stops pregnancy while it is fitted. It is also known as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS for short), or Mirena.</p>
<p><strong>Tablets</strong></p>
<p>Taking hormone tablets can reduce the build up of blood in the lining of the womb. If a woman chooses to take tablets, they can have either a combined tablet containing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, or a tablet containing the hormone progesterone on its own. These medicines are often used to prevent pregnancy, but they can also help with heavy and painful periods. The combined tablet is also called the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC). The combined pill is usually taken for 21 out of the 28 days of the menstrual cycle. If progesterone alone is taken, it is during days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Injections</strong></p>
<p>Progesterone can be taken as an injection for heavy menstrual bleeding. The injection is called Depo-Provera. Injections need to be administered every 12 weeks. Having progesterone this way will reduce the chances of getting pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>GnRH analogues</strong></p>
<p>There are injections of another type of hormone treatment, called gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, or GnRH analogues, to help heavy periods. GnRH analogues can also be taken as a nasal spray. These medicines are usually used to thin the lining of the womb before having surgery to remove it.</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="217_2_further-info_1053_0"><p>Surgery treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding involves having an operation to remove the womb lining (the endometrium), or to block the blood supply to the womb.</p>
<p>An operation to remove the lining of the womb is called endometrial ablation, or endometrial resection. This operation can be done in a number of ways. During the operation a surgeon may insert a&nbsp;hysteroscope (which looks a bit like a very small telescope)&nbsp;into the vagina and through the cervix so they can see inside the womb. They then use tiny instruments to remove the lining of the womb. They may use:</p>
<ul>
<li>A heated wire that burns away the lining of the womb. This is called transcervical endometrial resection.</li>
<li>A heated ball that burns away the lining of the womb. This is called rollerball ablation.</li>
<li>A laser beam that cuts away the lining of the womb. This is called laser ablation.</li>
<li>A special device that carries an electric current that burns away the lining of the womb (an electrode). This is called vaporising electrode ablation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctor may suggest taking drugs that thin the womb lining before having one of these operations.</p>
<p>There are other ways of doing this operation allowing surgeons to remove the lining of the womb without using a hysteroscope. Instead they may use one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>They may insert a sheath containing a special device that carries an electric current that burns away the lining of the womb (an electrode) which is placed through the cervix. This sheath is pulled back to allow the electrode to expand and fill the uterus. A small electric current is then passed through the electrode into the uterus to remove the lining of the womb, after which the electrode is removed. This is called impedance-controlled bipolar radiofrequency ablation.</li>
<li>They may put a balloon into the womb through your cervix and then fill it with fluid. The fluid is heated up and left in place for about eight minutes to kill the womb lining. This is called thermal uterine balloon therapy.</li>
<li>They may insert a small probe through the cervix and into the womb. The probe is moved over the lining of the womb to remove it. This is called microwave ablation.</li>
<li>They may insert a heated salt solution into the uterus to remove the lining of the womb. This is called free fluid thermal endometrial ablation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operations that don't use a hysteroscope do not require a general anaesthetic during surgery. Local anaesthetics are usually used instead. This means being awake during the operation, but the area will be numbed.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-31">31</span>]<span id="reference-31" class="content-reference">Lethaby A, Hickey M, Garry R.

<p>If heavy periods are caused by growths in the womb called fibroids, an operation called uterine artery embolisation can be chosen.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span> During this operation a surgeon inserts a small tube into the groin so that small plastic beads can be passed into the blood vessels that supply blood to the fibroids. This reduces the blood supply to the womb and causes the fibroid to shrink. This should help make periods lighter.</p>
<p>The doctor may suggest drugs that thin the womb lining before having one of these operations.</p></div>

<p>The main options for treatment are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>. This means checking your symptoms to see if they change. You can monitor your symptoms yourself (self-monitoring) or with your healthcare team. You can choose to have other treatments later if you decide you want them.</li>
<li><strong>Hormone treatments</strong>. These are tablets, injections, or a small device fitted inside your womb (the hormonal coil). These are treatments to reduce your bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Non-hormone treatments</strong>. These are medicines that don't contain hormones that reduce your bleeding.</li>
<li><strong>Surgery or procedure other than hysterectomy</strong>. This is an operation to remove the lining of your womb, or reduce the blood supply to your womb. This makes the blood flow lighter.</li>
<li><strong>Hysterectomy</strong>. This is an operation to remove your womb. Your ovaries and fallopian tubes may be removed as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your choices depend on many things, including your age, how much your symptoms bother you, what's causing your heavy periods, and whether you want to have children.</p>
<p>The decisions women with heavy menstrual bleeding are making include:</p>
<ul>
<li>My symptoms are getting worse. Should I consider taking medicines or should I try active monitoring first?</li>
<li>My symptoms are severe. Should I consider having an operation or should I try medicines first?</li>
<li>I want to have some kind of surgery to treat my symptoms. Should I choose to have surgery to remove my womb, or procedures to treat or remove the lining of my womb?</li>
</ul>
<p>The right choice for you may change over time. This decision aid aims to help you make the right choice for you now, but you may wish to change to a different option in future.</p>                    </div>

The cycle of events that happens in the body that causes a woman to have a period is called a menstrual cycle. Women's menstrual cycles are controlled by their hormones.</p>
<p>Here's what happens every month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women's hormones make the lining of the womb (the endometrium) thicker and softer, so it's ready for pregnancy.</li>
<li>If a woman doesn't become pregnant, the hormone levels start to drop.</li>
<li>This drop in hormones causes the womb lining to swell.</li>
<li>The extra blood and tissue that made the womb lining thicker comes away. This is called a period.</li>
<li>Most girls and women lose about seven to eight teaspoonfuls of blood during a normal period (30 to 40 millilitres).[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-68">68</span>]<span id="reference-68" class="content-reference">Apgar BS, Kaufman AH, George-Nwogu U, et al.

<p>The GP will ask about symptoms and the menstrual cycle. He or she will also ask if there is any bleeding between cycles or after sexual intercourse and will ask about any medications, including contraceptives, that are being used.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>The GP may need to do some physical tests, which could include a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam involves the GP examining the vulva (the external sexual organs) for any external cause of bleeding. He or she will feel the womb from inside the vagina and by pressing on the abdomen. They may use an instrument called a speculum to hold the walls of the vagina open so that they can check the neck of the womb (the cervix) for infections and unusual growths.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span></p>
<p>Some women may need to have a blood test.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span></p>
<p>The GP may recommend an ultrasound scan of the womb to help show if there is a specific cause of the heavy bleeding. During the scan a small probe is either inserted into the vagina or placed on the skin of the lower abdomen and pelvic area. The ultrasound probe is attached to a machine that sends out high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off the womb to create a picture.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span></p>
<p>Depending on the results of these tests, the GP may suggest more specialist tests.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span></p>

<li>The tests may include a hysteroscopy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span> This means a doctor will use an instrument called a hysteroscope, which is attached to a small camera, to look inside the womb. This test takes place in hospital, but staying overnight is not usual. It takes around 30 minutes. A surgeon will use a speculum to hold the walls of the vagina open, and then insert a hysteroscope into the vagina, through the cervix, and into the womb. Some women have a local anaesthetic, meaning they will be awake but the pelvic area will be numbed. Some women may have a general anaesthetic, meaning they will be asleep throughout the procedure.</li>
<li>Some women have a tiny sample of tissue removed from the womb to look for any changes to the cells under a microscope.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span> This is called a biopsy. The doctor will discuss this with the patient first if they think a biopsy is required.</li>
<li>Another way specialist doctors can examine the womb is by doing a test called saline infusion sonography. This test usually comes after other tests have been done.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span> A thin tube (a catheter) is put inside the womb through the vagina. A salt water solution is then passed through the catheter to fill the womb. This helps improve the images the doctors get during an ultrasound scan.</li>
<li>The doctor may also suggest an MRI scan. This test usually comes after other tests have been done.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Heavy menstrual bleeding. January 2007. Clinical guideline 44. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG44 (accessed on 6 November 2012).</span> An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. During the scan, the woman lies on a flat bed which is moved into a scanning tube which scans the womb. The scan takes around half an hour and is painless.</li>
