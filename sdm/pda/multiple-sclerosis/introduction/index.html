<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>People's immune systems may start to react against treatment with interferons. Their bodies may then produce another type of protein (antibody) against the interferons in our&nbsp;bloodstream.

<p>Most people want to know how the various types of interferon beta might fit around their lifestyle. They want to know about how they will manage injections in different situations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>At work</li>
<li>On holiday</li>
<li>In social situations, or</li>
<li>Doing leisure activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>An MS specialist nurse can advise you how the various types of interferon beta might affect these things. They will also show you how to inject yourself with different injection devices. This will include a demonstration of how to use an automatic injection device (auto injector).</p>
<p>Some people find that auto injectors make injecting themselves easier - particularly in hard-to-reach places. With most types of auto injector, it also means that you don't need to see the needle going in, which can be a help if you are not keen on needles.</p>
<p>All types of interferon beta that are injected under the skin (Rebif, Betaferon, and&nbsp;Extavia)&nbsp;use a shorter, thinner needle than Avonex, which is injected into the muscle.</p>
<p>The table below shows how often the different types of interferon beta need to be injected and stored. This might start to give you an idea of how they might fit around your life. For example, if you're out and about or at work, will you be able to take a medicine that needs to be mixed first? Or would a medicine that you need to mix fit your lifestyle better because it doesn't need to be stored in a fridge?</p>

<p>Once you have made your decision, you&nbsp;can either give&nbsp;yourself these injections, or a friend or family member can be trained to give them to you. You don't need to go to the hospital to have the injections.</p>
<p>Things to consider include: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to inject yourself? If not, is there someone who can help you?</li>
<li>You will need to have a secure storage area for your syringes and needles, and a special box to discard needles.</li>
<li>Avonex and the premixed version of Rebif need to be kept in the fridge. For travelling, you can get travel kits with cold-packs for the medicines that need to be kept cold.</li>
<li>Betaferon and Extavia need to be mixed before injection, which takes a minute or two, but it means they do not need to be stored in the fridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a woman planning on becoming pregnant, you should discuss your treatment with your doctor first.</p>
<p>People going on holiday need to take proof of medical need to travel on an aircraft with hypodermic needles.</p>
<p>If you take interferon beta, you will have regular blood tests in the first year to check that you are tolerating the medicine well. If there are no problems then you won't need to have blood testing so often. These tests may have an impact on things like travel plans, especially in the early stages of taking the drug.</p></div>

<p>People having glatiramer acetate injections can get a condition called lipoatrophy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-20">20</span>]<span id="reference-20" class="content-reference">Edgar CM, Brunet DG, Fenton P, et al. Lipoatrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis on glatiramer acetate. Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences. 2004; 31: 58-63.</span>&nbsp;If you have lipoatrophy, the fat beneath the skin is lost in small areas. This makes small 'craters' or indentations in the skin, which do not usually get better with time. We do not know why lipoatrophy happens. It seems to be more common in women than in men. This condition can be minimised by inspecting injection sites regularly and avoiding further injections in places that have been affected.</p>
<p>Glatiramer acetate can cause the heart to beat faster than normal straight after the injection, so it may not be suitable for people who have heart problems. You should talk to your doctor about any heart problems you may have had before taking this medicine.</p>

<p>An MS specialist nurse can demonstrate&nbsp;how to inject yourself with different injection devices. This will include a demonstration of how to use an automatic injection device (auto injector). Some people find that auto injectors make injecting themselves easier - particularly in hard-to-reach places.

<p>Most people want to know how the various types of interferon beta might fit around their lifestyle. They want to know about how they will manage injections in different situations such as:</p>

<li>Doing leisure activities.</li>

<p>Your MS nurse can help you talk through all of these things and help you work out what is the best option for you.</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;then give yourself the injection, or a friend or family member can be trained to give it to you. You don&rsquo;t need to go hospital for injections.</p>
<p>Things to consider include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to inject yourself? If not, is there someone who can help you?</li>
<li>The glatiramer acetate injection needs to be stored in a fridge. If it cannot be stored in a fridge, it can be stored at room temperature, but only for one month.</li>
<li>You will need to have a secure storage area for your syringes and needles, and a special box to discard needles.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Glatiramer acetate injections are given under the skin, so they use a shorter, thinner needle than some other disease-modifying drugs.</li>

                                            <p>This decision aid is to help people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their health care team decide whether a disease modifying drug is suitable for them, and if so which one.&nbsp;This decision aid&nbsp;is only for people with relapsing-remitting MS who have never used disease modifying drugs before.</p>
<p>The four treatment&nbsp;options&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active monitoring and support:</strong>&nbsp;this means people will monitor their symptoms and have regular checks with their health professionals. Although people won't be&nbsp;taking medication to control relapses, they can start taking medication if they have a relapse.&nbsp;All people with multiple sclerosis can have treatment to manage their symptoms including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological support, advice to help them manage their own illness (self-management), and medicine to control symptoms. For the purposes of this decision aid, active monitoring&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;people who choose not to take a disease modifying drug (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab), although they may take medicines to treat their symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Interferon beta:&nbsp;</strong>Interferon beta is a drug based on naturally produced proteins that help reduce the inflammation that causes nerve damage. Reducing nerve damage helps reduce the chance of multiple scleroris getting worse or relapsing.&nbsp;Interferon beta is a drug people&nbsp;can inject themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Glatiramer acetate:&nbsp;</strong>Glatiramer acetate is a mix of substances called amino acids. This drug helps to stop the body's immune system attacking the coating around&nbsp;the nerves. Reducing nerve damage helps reduce the chance of multiple scleroris getting worse or relapsing.&nbsp;Glatiramer acetate is a drug people&nbsp;can inject themselves.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Natalizumab: </strong></strong>Natalizumab is a drug that affects how&nbsp;the immune system works. It stops&nbsp;the white blood cells (one of the types of cells your immune system makes to help fight infection) passing from&nbsp;the blood into&nbsp;the brain and nervous system. This drug is given as an infusion every four weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone will be able to choose from all of these options. Some of these medications are not suitable for everyone. For example, natalizumab can only be taken by people who have severe relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that is getting worse quickly. MS specialist nurses or neurologists can help people decide which treatments are suitable for them.</p>
<p>Although active monitoring is listed as a distinct treatment option&nbsp;in this decision aid, everyone who has MS, whether they are taking disease modifying drugs or not, will be actively monitored and provided with self-care support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right treatment decision for you may change over time. This decision aid aims to help you make the right choice for you now. You may wish to change your mind if your situation or your life changes. If you choose a disease modifying drug, and then decide to change treatment, you should speak to your healthcare team. This decision aid is only for people who have not taken disease modifying drugs before, so it won't be the right place for you to get help if you have already taken a disease modifying drug.</p>
<p>The decisions people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have never used disease modifying drugs are making include:</p>

<li>Should I start taking disease modifying drugs, as well as my other treatments,&nbsp;to reduce my chance of relapse?</li>
<li>If I start taking a disease modifying drug, is there one that is best for me?</li>
<li>If I don't take a disease modifying drug, will my multiple sclerosis do me more harm?</li>
</ul>
<p>All people with multiple sclerosis can have treatment to manage their symptoms including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological support,&nbsp;advice to help them manage their own illness (self-management), and medicine to&nbsp;control symptoms.&nbsp;Specialist health professionals will work with people with multiple sclerosis to find the best way to manage their symptoms before talking through the disease modifying medications options.</p>                    </div>

<p>The&nbsp;CNS includes&nbsp;the brain and&nbsp;the spinal cord.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-34">34</span>]<span id="reference-34" class="content-reference">Martini FH, Ober WC, Garrison CW, et al. Fundamentals of anatomy and physiology. 5th edition. Prentice Hall, New Jersey, NJ; 2001.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The brain controls everything&nbsp;the body does.&nbsp;The brain controls how&nbsp;a person&nbsp;moves, speaks, recognises&nbsp;their family, thinks, and remembers things.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;spinal cord is the main highway of&nbsp;the CNS. It is a big bundle of nerves that runs down&nbsp;the back from&nbsp;the brain. It sits inside the bones of&nbsp;the spine and carries nerve signals to and from&nbsp;the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;brain and spinal cord are made up of billions of nerve cells that share information. The information moves from one nerve cell to another as chemical signals. Groups of nerve cells have specific jobs. For example, some let you think, learn, remember, and plan. Others let you see and hear. Others manage the millions of actions that keep&nbsp;the body working.</p>
<p>Many of the nerves in&nbsp;the brain and spinal cord have a coating called myelin, which is made mainly of fat. Myelin helps signals travel quickly and smoothly along&nbsp;the nerves.</p></div>

<p>The&nbsp;immune system's job is to help protect&nbsp;the body&nbsp;by fighting off infection.&nbsp;In some people, the&nbsp;immune system goes wrong and attacks the myelin coating around the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-4">4</span>]<span id="reference-4" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. In: Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, et al (editors). Harrison's principles of internal medicine. 15th edition. McGraw Hill, New York, NY; 2001.</span>&nbsp;This&nbsp;causes inflammation (swelling), and the myelin coating may be damaged or destroyed. The damage to the myelin coating&nbsp;around the nerve is what causes the symptoms of MS, as signals travelling along&nbsp;the nerves may slow down, get blocked, speed up, or get mixed up. This can affect&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the body. For example,&nbsp;the brain may send a message to&nbsp;the hand to pick up a cup. If the signal gets mixed up,&nbsp;the hand may not move the way&nbsp;a person&nbsp;wants it to, or the movement may be too weak for the person&nbsp;to pick up the cup.</p>
<p>There are three main types of MS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relapsing-remitting MS. People get bouts of symptoms called relapses. These last for at least 24 hours, and usually for a few weeks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Secondary progressive MS. Some of&nbsp;the symptoms stay after a relapse and get worse over time.</li>
<li>Primary progressive MS.&nbsp;The symptoms never really go away from the start. They slowly get worse but may vary over time. Most people with primary progressive MS do not have relapses. However, relapses can occasionally happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>In relapsing-remitting MS, most of the damage to the nervous system is to the myelin around nerves, rather than the nerve cells themselves.</p>
<p>Most people with MS get the relapsing-remitting type, then go on to have the secondary progressive type. The information in this decision aid is for people with relapsing-remitting MS.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-36">36</span>]<span id="reference-36" class="content-reference">Hauser SL, Goodkin DE.

<p>Here are some definitions of terms&nbsp;that you may find useful when reading this patient decision aid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relapse:</strong> This is a period in which a person with MS&nbsp;suffers has an acute (sudden) worsening of symptoms&nbsp;they have had already, or they have completely new symptoms for at least 24 hours, without a fever or another explanation for the worsening of symptoms. It usually lasts for several days or weeks. After a relapse symptoms often, but not always, improve over a period of weeks or months.</li>
<li><strong>Disability:</strong> This is when a person with MS loses the ability to perform a physical&nbsp;or mental function.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tiredness and weakness</li>
<li>Numbness and odd sensations</li>
<li>Problems moving parts of&nbsp;the body</li>
<li>Dim or blurred vision</li>
<li>Dizziness and vertigo</li>

<li>Bladder problems</li>
<li>Sexual problems</li>
<li>Bowel problems</li>
<li>Emotional upset</li>
<li>Feelings of confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The symptoms&nbsp;a person&nbsp;gets depends on where in&nbsp;their brain and spinal cord the inflammation happens. The inflammation that causes&nbsp;MS symptoms can come and go.</p>
<p>People with MS can be affected in different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people&nbsp;might get only some of these symptoms, others might get most of them. Most people&nbsp;have a few at a time.</li>
<li>Some people have certain symptoms at one time and other symptoms at a different time.</li>
<li>Symptoms can be mild or severe. They are sometimes so mild that&nbsp;people&nbsp;don't notice them, especially at first.</li>
<li>Symptoms can last just a day or two, or for weeks on end.</li>

<p>The pattern of&nbsp;symptoms depends on the type of MS a person has. &nbsp;Most people who have relapsing-remitting MS have a permanent background of symptoms, which can include any of the symptoms&nbsp;listed here.</p></div>

<p><strong>Where a person lives: </strong>MS is more common in colder countries that are further from the equator.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the UK, MS is more common in north-east Scotland and the Orkney and Shetland Islands than in the rest of the country.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-41">41</span>]<span id="reference-41" class="content-reference">Compston A.

</ul>
<p>No one knows for sure why this is.&nbsp;A person's&nbsp;chance of getting MS seems to depend on where&nbsp;they lived as a child. So if someone moved from a colder country to a warmer one after the age of about 15, it doesn't lower&nbsp;their chance of getting MS.</p></div>

<p>The neurologist will order an MRI scan to look for areas of nerve damage around&nbsp;the brain and spinal cord. Blood tests can rule out other possible causes of&nbsp;the symptoms.

<p>The disease modifying drugs&nbsp;we discuss in this decision aid are the ones that are offered to people first. These drugs are to help prevent relapses, or to reduce the number of relapses people have. If they don&rsquo;t work, or they stop working, people are likely to be offered a combination of drugs.</p>
<p>There are many things to think about if you and the health professionals supporting you decide that a disease-modifying drug is right for you. One thing many people want to know is how the various medicines might work around their lifestyle. So people might want to know things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the medicines need to be kept in the fridge?</li>
<li>Which need to be taken more often than others?</li>
<li>Does taking these medicines restrict how much someone can travel?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the medicines need to be injected by that person taking them. Injections can, understandably, be worrying to many people at first. The information on medicines in this decision aid should help people begin to understand how different drug choices might fit into their lives.</p>
<p>Although active monitoring is listed as a distinct treatment option&nbsp;in this decision aid, everyone who has MS - whether they are taking disease modifying drugs or not - will be actively monitored. This means people will monitor their symptoms, and have regular checks with their health professionals to discuss how they are doing.</p>
<p>There are also treatments available for individual&nbsp;symptoms: for example, drugs to relax the muscles for people who often get muscle cramps.</p>
<p>If you have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, there are many places you can get help. About 100,000 people in the UK have MS, so you are far from alone. There are patient support groups where you can meet and talk to people like you. These are easy to find online, or you could ask your doctor where to find them.</p>
<p>Many people find these support groups helpful. You may find that talking with other people who are living with MS can help you make decisions about your treatment. Or you may just find that it feels good to talk about your condition with someone other than a health professional. There are plenty of people willing to listen and to help.</p>
