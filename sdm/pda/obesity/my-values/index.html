<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>

<p>Your body needs energy all the time, even if you are not doing much. You need it just to keep warm and move around. The more active you are, the more energy you use.</p>
<p>Not everyone is the same when it comes to energy needs. The amount of energy you need depends on&nbsp;your <strong>metabolic rate</strong> - how quickly&nbsp;your body uses,&nbsp;or 'burns', the energy in the food you eat.</p>
<p>Your brain helps to keep your weight steady by balancing how much you eat with how much energy you burn.

<p>People can become very overweight when they take in many more calories from food and drink than their body uses for energy. The body stores those extra calories as fat, and people put on weight.</p>
<p>Being very overweight can cause&nbsp;major health problems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Arthritis</li>
<li>Heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting back to a healthy weight can help people who are very overweight avoid these problems.</p>
<p>When healthcare professionals talk about a 'healthy' or 'ideal' weight, they mean a weight that shouldn&rsquo;t cause serious health problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">Sandowski SA. What is the ideal body weight? Family Practice. 2000; 17: 348-351.</span></p>
<p>Most doctors use the <strong>body mass index</strong> (BMI for short) to work out whether someone's weight&nbsp;is healthy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-3">3</span>]<span id="reference-3" class="content-reference">National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Obesity: the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children. December 2006.

Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic. Report of a WHO consultation. WHO Technical Series. World Health Organisation, Geneva. 2000; 894: 1-253.</span> Your BMI is a single number that's worked out from your height and weight. You can calculate your own BMI using a formula. Your BMI is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. If you find this complicated, you can find BMI calculators on the internet that will <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/Healthyweightcalculator.aspx">do the sums for you</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A BMI of less than 18.5 means you are underweight</li>
<li>A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 means your weight is normal</li>
<li>A BMI of between 25 and 29.9 means you are probably overweight</li>
<li>A BMI of 30 or more means you are probably obese (very overweight).</li>
</ul>
<p>But someone's BMI score is not a perfect way to tell&nbsp;whether their weight might be causing them health problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-5">5</span>]<span id="reference-5" class="content-reference">Padwal RS, Pajewski NM, Allison DB, et al. Using the Edmonton obesity staging system to predict mortality in a population-representative cohort of people with overweight and obesity. Canadian Medical Association Journal. 2011; 183: 1059-1066.</span> For example, some muscular athletes have BMI scores that suggest they are very overweight, because muscle is heavier than fat. That's misleading because being very overweight means that someone has too much body fat, not that they are muscular.</p>
<p>For most of us, though, working out our BMI is a quick and simple way of finding if our weight might cause health problems.</p></div>

<p>People become very overweight because they eat more food than their body uses. The body stores this extra food as fat and, over time, people become overweight.

This means people can eat the same amount of food but get different amounts of 'fuel' from the different types of food.</p>
<p>To maintain our weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average man needs to eat or drink about 2,500 calories a day</li>
<li>The average woman needs to eat or drink about&nbsp;2,000 calories a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are just averages, so it's not the same for everyone. People's bodies are different, and some people's bodies can use more calories from the same amount of food as someone else's. We don't know why this happens. It may have to do with our genes or hormones.</p>
<p>But these numbers are a useful rough guide for most people. There are many ways to find out how many calories are in the food we eat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food packaging. Many food labels will say how many calories the products contain.</li>
<li>Books. Pocket-sized calorie-counting books are available for a few pounds. They list how many calories are in different foods.</li>
<li>The internet. Calorie-counting websites can be a useful source of information on food.</li>
<li>Your doctor or practice nurse. Your local surgery or health centre may have information leaflets on finding out about calories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of foods that have a lot of calories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatty meat, and fatty foods in general</li>
<li>Sweets, chocolate, and other sugary foods</li>
<li>Cakes, pastries, pies, biscuits, crisps</li>
<li>Most cheeses</li>
<li>Fried foods</li>
<li>Processed meats (pate, sausages)</li>
<li>Fruit juice, soft drinks</li>
<li>Milk shakes, ice cream, cream</li>
<li>Most fast food</li>
<li>Alcoholic drinks</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of foods that have fewer calories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lean meat</li>
<li>White fish</li>
<li>Most fruits</li>
<li>Most vegetables</li>
<li>Salads</li>
<li>Beans, lentils</li>
</ul>
<p>Gaining weight might not just be about how much we eat. It's possible that some foods may be more likely than others to cause weight gain, regardless of how many calories they contain. There is growing evidence that sugar in particular may cause people to put on weight.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Te Morenga, L. Dietary sugars and body weight: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies. BMJ. 2013; 346: 7492.</span> As well as sweets, cakes, and desserts, lots of processed foods, snacks, and soft drinks contain large amounts of sugar.</p>
<p>Changes in people's lives and lifestyles can affect their eating habits and how active they are. Some things that might increase someone's chances of becoming overweight include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childbirth (women are likely to be about a kilogram [2 pounds] heavier after each pregnancy, but many women lose this weight)</li>
<li>Illness</li>
<li>Trauma</li>
<li>Job changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines can make people gain weight. These include some treatments for depression and anxiety (such as lithium, clozapine, and other antipsychotic drugs), corticosteroids, and tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<p>You can talk to your healthcare professional about any medicines you are taking if you think they might be making you gain weight, or if you think you may be gaining weight because of a medical condition.</p></div>

<p>So waist measurements are important because people who are apple shaped are more likely than people who are pear shaped to have heart problems caused by their weight.</p></div>

<p>If you are a woman who is very overweight and planning a family, it&rsquo;s a good idea to lose weight before you become pregnant. Women who become pregnant when very overweight are more likely to have problems during pregnancy.

<p>If you are very overweight and you lose weight, you may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower your chance of having serious health problems</li>
<li>Help yourself to live longer</li>
<li>Feel more positive about yourself and your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to lose weight and to stay healthy. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise and diet programmes</li>
<li>Medication</li>
<li>Psychological help (therapy)</li>
<li>Surgery (as a last resort).</li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery is usually only recommended when other methods haven't worked well enough and someone's weight is affecting their health.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure where to get help, your doctor or practice nurse is a good place to start. The NHS supports several weight-loss programmes, and your healthcare professional can help you find one that suits you.</p>
<p>Remember, if you try treatments like psychological therapy or medications you still need to carry on exercising and eating sensibly. Diet and exercise should go hand in hand with any other treatments.</p></div>

<p>Lifestyle changes are the most important thing that very overweight people can do to make a difference to their health. Whatever other weight-loss treatments you choose, lifestyle changes go hand in hand with them to get the best results. The other treatments people can choose for weight loss won't work as well without making lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Old habits can be hard to break. Forming new habits can take time. But you can choose the approach that works best for you. Some people find that starting gradually with small goals works for them, while others find it easier to 'dive in' and make big changes.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-20">20</span>]<span id="reference-20" class="content-reference">Casazza K, Fontaine KR, Astrup A, et al. Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity. New England Journal of Medicine. 2013; 368: 446-454.</span> It's up to you. If one approach doesn't work for you, there are plenty of others.</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes that should help people lose weight include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating less overall</li>
<li>Eating healthier foods</li>
<li>Eating lower-calorie foods</li>
<li>Exercising more</li>
<li>Weighing yourself regularly. Adults who do this are more likely to have control over their weight.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The first aim of all these lifestyle changes is to help people lose weight. But how much weight loss makes a difference, and how much is realistic?</p>
<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number based on someone's weight and height that helps work out whether their weight is likely to cause them health problems.&nbsp;Broadly speaking, people whose BMI is between 30 and 35 are advised to lose between 5 percent and 10 percent of their body weight. People whose BMI is greater than 35 are advised to lose more - between 15 percent and 20 percent of their body weight.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span></p>
<p>To lose this amount of weight most people need to do between four and five hours of exercise each week. The exercise should be of at least 'moderate intensity'. This means it should take more effort than ordinary activities. You should feel out of breath, and 'work up a sweat' - but without going overboard. People might do this kind of exercise by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gardening</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
<li>Doing aerobics or water aerobics</li>
<li>Jogging</li>
<li>Brisk walking</li>
<li>Playing team sports or tennis</li>
<li>Working out in a gym.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though you may be doing exercise on your own and not as part of a programme, it's a good idea to check with your healthcare professional before you start, to make sure you don't overdo it to begin with, and also to make sure you're doing enough. So you might start gently at first, but over time you will need to increase the amount you do.</p>
<p>People find it easier to exercise regularly if they're doing something they enjoy. For example, if going to a gym bores you, but you love the outdoors, then playing an outdoor sport, jogging, or walking briskly in the local park may suit you much better. Many people find they really enjoy exercising once they get the habit.</p>
<p>Exercise time can be broken up into daily amounts. And people don&rsquo;t have to do all their daily exercise in one go. For example, you could do a few short sessions instead of one long one.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span></p>
<p>People trying to lose weight through lifestyle changes should try to eat and drink about 600 calories a day less than they are using up through normal living and exercise. The average recommended daily intake of calories is 2,500 for men and 2,000 for women. People need to eat about 600 calories a day less than this until they've lost the weight they want to lose.</p>
<p>Learning about what foods make people put on weight can help.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

<p>Some people might find that setting themselves small realistic goals helps them to stay focused on losing weight.

                        <div data-cms-content-id="263_2_further-info_1289_0"><p>A formal weight-loss programme is a plan that people follow to help them lose weight. It could be a diet or exercise plan, or a mixture of both. Programmes that include both exercise and diet plans are more effective than programmes that just focus on one or the other.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span> And programmes that also include some psychological support work even better. These programmes help people change their behaviour and how they think about food.</p>
<p>Your doctor can help you find a plan that suits you. They are likely to suggest a diet plan that involves eating fewer high-calorie, fatty, and sugary foods, and a sensible exercise plan. If you choose to work out a weight-loss programme with your healthcare professional, you can have follow-up appointments to see how you are doing. Your doctor may also want to test things that are affected by your weight, such as cholesterol and blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>You should be able to get involved with weight-loss programmes in your local area. You could join a programme that is run or supported by the NHS. Or you could join a commercial weight-loss programme, but you will have to pay for these.</p>
<p>Some weight-loss programmes are listed below. These are not the only ones available, but they are examples of the kind of programmes available and should give you an idea of the kinds of help you can get. These programmes don't work for everyone, and some of them will suit some people better than others. You may have heard of some of them already, and have an idea of what kind of programme might work for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shape Up</strong>. Programmes like this one, which is run by the NHS, focus on exercise, healthy eating, and behavioural support to help change the way people think about food.</li>
<li><strong>Counterweight</strong>. Programmes like this one aim to help people lose weight and keep it off, through diet, exercise, and changing the way people think about food. These programmes sometimes involve replacing foods with 'formula' foods in the early stages. Formula foods are meal replacements that can be drinks, soups, or snack bars that contain nutrients but very few calories. If you want to try one of these very low-calorie formula diets, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most successful programmes are those that contain all three of the elements necessary to lose weight and keep it off:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diet</strong>. This usually means eating less overall, eating less-fattening foods, and eating healthier foods. In the early stages of a programme, it may mean replacing some or all meals with formula foods.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong>. Exercise on its own may not help people lose a lot of weight. But it is crucial for good health in people who are very overweight, and for keeping weight off once you've lost it.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological and behavioural support</strong>. Changing how we think about food, and understanding our eating habits, can help many people change their behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which diet?</strong></p>
<p>Below is a list of some of the most common diet plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low fat</li>
<li>Low calorie</li>
<li>Very low calorie (these may include 'formula' foods, or meal replacements - it's a good idea to talk to your doctor if you want to try one of these diets)</li>
<li>Low carbohydrate</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these diets have been shown to help people lose weight.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span> But everyone is different, and some diet plans simply won't 'feel' right to some people. Different methods work for different people, perhaps depending on their lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>How much exercise?</strong></p>
<p>A formal exercise programme should include between four and five hours of exercise each week. If this sounds like a lot, remember that, to begin with, exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to mean running, playing sports, or going to a gym. You can start slowly - especially if you haven't done much exercise for a while - and then do more over time.</p>
<p>A sensible exercise programme, such as one you might get from your healthcare professional, will take account of things like your age, your weight, and how fit you are.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span></p>
<p>People find it easier to exercise regularly if they're doing something they enjoy. For example, if going to a gym bores you, but you love the outdoors, then playing an outdoor sport, or jogging or brisk walking in the local park may suit you much better. Many people find they really enjoy exercising once they get the habit.</p></div>

<p>Most people who are very overweight and stick to diet plans manage to lose about 5 percent of their body weight after one year. Losing this amount of weight reduces people's risk of health problems.

<p>Very low-calorie diets may help very overweight people lose more weight and lose it more quickly than other diets.

<p>You may have heard that you are more likely to keep weight off if you lose it slowly rather than if you lose a lot of weight quickly. But there is no one approach that works best for everyone.

<li>If you have problems with mobility (getting around and doing things), losing weight could make a big difference.</li>
<li>Exercising may make you feel fitter and able to do more. The health benefits of exercise go beyond helping you lose weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>But following a weight-loss programme does mean making some changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>It means finding time to exercise. Many people find they enjoy exercise once they get started.</li>
<li>You may find that the foods on your diet plan cost more than those you usually eat. Going out with friends and family may be harder if you can&rsquo;t eat and drink what you used to.</li>
<li>You may have to plan your meals ahead to make sure you have the right things to eat. Eating well may mean changing the way you shop and where you eat out.

<p>The treatments used most often are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Behavioural therapy</li>
<li>Cognitive behavioural therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>For people who are very overweight, the therapist aims to help give people a new set of skills to help them change their diet and become more active.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Therapy often includes talking about your feelings, including how you feel about your body shape, your weight, and eating.</li>
<li>If you binge on food because you're unhappy or stressed, your therapist can help you deal with that.</li>
<li>The changes shouldn't end when therapy stops. With time and practice, people can learn to help themselves whenever they feel their old eating habits taking over again.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often have behavioural therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy as part of a group of about 10 people. They meet for one or two hours each week, for between three and five months. They often do homework between sessions.</p>
<p>Behavioural therapy can involve some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-monitoring</strong> means keeping track of your habits so you become more aware of what you eat.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-45">45</span>]<span id="reference-45" class="content-reference">Glenny AM, O'Meara S, Melville A, et al. The treatment and prevention of obesity: a systematic review of the literature. International Journal of Obesity. 1997; 21: 715-737.</span>&nbsp;It often means keeping a food diary. Each day you write down what you eat, when and where it was, and how you felt at the time.&nbsp;You and your therapist can then talk about the times when you have eaten too much or reached for high-calorie snacks. You can talk about ways of avoiding this in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Stimulus control</strong> involves learning the &lsquo;cues&rsquo; or triggers in your social life or home life that make you want to eat too much. You then learn to avoid or change these cues. For example, you may overeat whenever you see a certain friend. Meeting the friend in a place where there isn't any food removes the cue.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> means rewarding yourself for making positive changes. For example, you might decide not to eat just before bed time for the next 10 days. If you succeed, you might buy yourself a small present.</li>
<li><strong>Social support</strong> means trying to lose weight with a friend or family member. It can also mean making sure that other people around you are helping your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> means you look at the way your thoughts affect how you feel and what you do. You learn to challenge unhelpful thoughts and think in a more positive way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other sources of psychological treatment</strong></p>
<p>The therapies mentioned above are not the only psychological treatments available for people who are very overweight. Many people get psychological support in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many general weight-loss programmes, including some that you can access through your doctor or practice nurse, include specific psychological and behavioural support.</li>
<li>Commercial weight-loss programmes often include psychological and behavioural support. For example, programmes that uses formula foods to help people lose weight very quickly may also include counselling and behavioural help.</li>
<li>Talking therapies don't have to come through the NHS. You can see a therapist privately if you prefer (but you will have to pay for this treatment).</li>
<li>Dietitians, nurses, and other health professionals can be a source of psychological support and counselling.</li>

<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number based on someone's weight and height that helps work out whether their weight is likely to cause them health problems. Doctors may recommend orlistat if someone's BMI is at least 28 and they have medical problems caused by their weight, or their BMI is at least 30.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

<p>You can buy low-dose orlistat from a pharmacist if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are 18 or over</li>
<li>Your BMI is 28 or more</li>
<li>You are willing to start a low-calorie, lower-fat diet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your pharmacist will be able to help with any questions you have about over-the-counter orlistat, and to give you advice about how to use it. Pharmacists may be able to help with many questions about weight loss.</p>
<p>Like any treatment for weight loss, orlistat will only work well if used alongside lifestyle changes, such as exercising and eating sensibly.</p>
<p>It's especially important that people who take orlistat also eat a low-fat diet. This is because if you take orlistat after a meal that contains a lot of fat you are likely to have diarrhoea.</p>
<p>People who take orlistat need to avoid foods that contain a lot of fat. No meal should contain more than 15 grams of fat. It's not always easy to weigh and measure all the fat in your food, so it's best to avoid very fatty foods altogether.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-53">53</span>]<span id="reference-53" class="content-reference">Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.

<p>Fatty foods include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried or deep-fried food</li>
<li>Butter, full-fat milk, margarine, cheese, cream, and ice cream</li>
<li>Fatty meat, such as burgers, sausages, ham, bacon, and fatty chops</li>
<li>Cakes and pastries.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's best to stick to lean meat, fresh vegetables, salads, and fruit. Many processed foods, such as ready meals, will tell you on the packaging how much fat they contain.</p>
<p>People usually take orlistat for 12 weeks. Doctors will recommend that people keep taking it only if they lose at least 5 percent (one twentieth) of their body weight in the first 12 weeks. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen, the medicine isn&rsquo;t working well enough and there is no point in taking more.</p></div>

This treatment will not be suitable or available for most people who are very overweight. Most people who have surgery have tried other treatments first.</p>
<p>Bariatric surgery usually means having an operation to change the way the stomach deals with food. The exception is having an intra-gastric balloon, which does not need an operation.</p>
<p>Many types of bariatric surgery have been used over the years. The ones that work best and are most used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gastric banding</strong>. The surgeon puts a thin band around the stomach, which divides it into two parts. The top part of the stomach becomes a small pouch that can hold only a few ounces of food. This means you will be able to eat much less. Banding is usually done with laparoscopic (&lsquo;keyhole&rsquo;) surgery, where the surgeon makes a series of small incisions (cuts) rather than one big one. Gastric bands are usually adjustable. This means the surgeon can make the band tighter or looser by adding or removing salt water. When the band is tightened, food passes out of the pouch very slowly and you stay full for longer. When the band is loosened, food passes more quickly through the digestive system. The band is loose to start with and then tightened as people become used to eating less.</li>
<li><strong>Gastric bypass</strong>. This is an operation to make the part of the stomach that deals with food smaller and the bowels (intestines) shorter. You then absorb fewer calories from the food you eat.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeve gastrectomy</strong>. The surgeon uses staples to divide the stomach into two. One side becomes a narrow tube to carry the food. The other side is no longer used. When you eat, the food goes into the narrow tube and leaves through your intestine (the tube that takes food away from your stomach) as normal. The intestine can now take only a few ounces of food. This means you should feel full sooner than usual. You will need to stop eating once you feel full.</li>
<li><strong>Intra-gastric balloon</strong>. Having an intra-gastric balloon fitted is not really surgery, as it can usually be done through the mouth without the need for an incision (cut). The balloon is made of soft silicone and filled with air or sterile salt water. When it is full it takes up a lot of space in the stomach, so you don&rsquo;t need to eat much before you feel full. The balloon is usually taken out after six months.</li>

<p>Even if someone is eligible for surgery, healthcare professionals will suggest that they try to lose weight using diet and exercise first, and that they think seriously about whether they are really willing to have surgery. This is because this kind of surgery can cause serious complications, and because people need to make major life changes afterwards.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, demand for bariatric surgery is high. This means that there are waiting lists. Waiting times will vary from area to area, but the wait is likely to be at least several months.</p>
<p>A person's Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number based on their weight and height that helps work out whether their weight is likely to cause them health problems. Healthcare professionals will usually only suggest surgery if:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-3">3</span>]<span id="reference-3" class="content-reference">National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

<ul>
<li>Your BMI is at least 40, or your BMI is between 35 and 40 and you have other health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure</li>
<li>You've tried hard to lose weight in other ways (dieting and exercising, or taking orlistat, for example) for at least six months, but none of these treatments has worked</li>
<li>You've been treated and supported by experts in a hospital obesity clinic but still haven't lost weight and kept it off</li>
<li>You are prepared to commit to long-term follow-up appointments, for years after the operation</li>
</ul>
<p>If your BMI is greater than 50, your doctor might recommend surgery before trying other weight-loss methods.</p>
<p>People also need to be fit enough to have a general anaesthetic and an operation. Healthcare professionals will want to be sure that people are committed to changing the way they eat afterwards.</p>
<p>The type of surgery or procedure people are offered may depend on several things. For example, someone may be offered an intra-gastric balloon if they are too overweight to have surgery. They may be offered one type of surgery because there is a surgeon in their area who has a lot of experience of doing that kind of operation.</p></div>

<p>Some people who lose a lot of weight after bariatric surgery find that they have a lot of loose skin some months after the operation, especially around the breasts, tummy, hips, arms, and legs. This is more likely to happen if you were very overweight for many years before your operation.</p>
<p>People usually notice these folds of skin between 12 and 18 months after surgery, as they lose more weight. Many people don&rsquo;t like how their skin looks when this happens. These folds of skin can be hard to keep clean. You may be more likely to get rashes and infections.</p>
<p>You can have cosmetic surgery to remove this excess skin. This treatment is not available on the NHS and you would have to pay for it yourself. Skin-removal treatment costs between &pound;1,500 and &pound;6,000, depending on the amount to be removed.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-72">72</span>]<span id="reference-72" class="content-reference">National Health Service.

<p>Bariatric surgery can have side effects that happen some time after the operation. These include:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-72">72</span>]<span id="reference-72" class="content-reference">National Health Service. NHS Choices.

<li>Gallstones. About <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Obesity/8-100.jpg" class="image-reference">8 in 100</a> people get gallstones after bariatric surgery, usually about 10 months afterwards. In most people, these don&rsquo;t cause any symptoms. But in some people they can irritate the gallbladder, causing pain, nausea, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes). If this happens to you, you will need an operation to remove your gallbladder.</li>
<li>Stomal stenosis. This is when a piece of food blocks the hole (stoma) that connects the stomach to the intestine. Over time, this happens in about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Obesity/20-100.jpg" class="image-reference">20 in 100</a> people who have a gastric bypass operation. The main symptom of stomal stenosis is vomiting.</li>
<li>Gastric band slippage. This can happen to about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Obesity/2-100.jpg" class="image-reference">2 in 100</a> people who have gastric band surgery. The band slips out of place, making the stomach pouch bigger than it should be. This can cause nausea, vomiting, and heartburn. If this happens to you, you will need an operation to put it right.</li>
<li>Nutritional deficiencies. After surgery you may not absorb all the nutrients you need from the small amount of food that your stomach can now hold. You will probably have to take vitamin supplements, possibly for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Vomiting. This may happen until you learn how much food your smaller stomach can manage. You may have to chew your food for longer before swallowing.</li>
<li>Hernias. This may happen after surgery if the organs in your abdomen, such as the intestines, move out of their normal positions when you lose weight quickly. It can be corrected by surgery.</li>
<li>Ulcers. This is more likely to happen after a gastric bypass than with other techniques. If you have pain that carries on for some time after the operation, speak to your doctor.</li>

<p>If having bariatric surgery helps you lose a lot of weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are likely to be more mobile</li>
<li>You may avoid some health problems that can go with being very overweight</li>
<li>You will have lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels than people of the same weight who don&rsquo;t have surgery.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-16">16</span>]<span id="reference-16" class="content-reference">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. National Clinical Guideline 115: Management of obesity. 2010. Available at http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/115/index.html (accessed on 20 December 2012).</span></li>
<li>You may feel fitter and more able to exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are many things to think about before deciding to have surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having this kind of surgery is not like having an operation that cures an illness once and for all. People who have this surgery cannot eat in the same way afterwards, and they need to exercise regularly. So surgery is not a one-time cure for being very overweight. It's the start of a treatment and lifestyle programme for life.</li>
<li>If you choose to have bariatric surgery and your doctor agrees it&rsquo;s best for you, you will probably have to follow a diet plan for several months before the operation.</li>
<li>Most types of bariatric surgery can be done using &lsquo;keyhole&rsquo; surgery (with small cuts) rather than open surgery (with a larger cut). But people who are extremely overweight may not be able to have keyhole surgery. Open surgery is a bigger operation. People who have open surgery may need to spend longer in hospital and will take longer to heal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recovery times are slightly different for the different types of surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Gastric band surgery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When people wake after gastric band surgery, they may feel some pain around the wound. This is normal and may last a few days. People may be given a blood-thinning medicine to stop them getting blood clots in their legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism). These problems happen to less than <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Obesity/0.5-100.jpg" class="image-reference">1 in 100</a> people.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-76">76</span>]<span id="reference-76" class="content-reference">Brasileiro AL, Miranda F Jr, Ettinger JE, et al. Incidence of lower limbs deep vein thrombosis after open and laparoscopic gastric bypass. Obesity Surgery. 2008; 18: 52-57.</span></li>
<li>For the first 24 hours people will only be allowed to drink small amounts of liquids. This is because the stomach will be swollen and sore from the surgery. Gradually people can start eating small amounts of food.</li>
<li>Most people can leave hospital within two days and will feel back to normal in between four and six weeks.</li>
<li>By this time, the stomach should have healed enough for the band to be adjusted. This is done by numbing the abdomen with a local anaesthetic, using an x-ray to find the band, then pumping salt water into the band through an opening called an access port. This all takes about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>It can take a bit of trial and error to adjust a gastric band to the right level. If the upper pouch is too large, it may not result in much weight loss. If the upper pouch is too small, it might cause vomiting after eating. The band may need to be adjusted several times before it works properly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gastric bypass surgery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When people wake after&nbsp;gastric bypass surgery, they will probably have a drip in their arm, to provide their body with liquids, and a tube in the bladder, known as a urinary catheter, to drain urine.</li>
<li>These tubes will be removed when someone is well enough to get out of bed. They may be given blood-thinning medicine to help prevent blood clots. They can only drink small amounts of liquids at first. They will gradually start to eat small amounts of solid food.</li>
<li>Most people are well enough to leave hospital between three and six days after surgery, and they recover completely in between three and five weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <strong>sleeve gastrectomy</strong> most people stay in hospital for three or four days, and can return to normal activities again between four and six weeks later.</p>
<p>Fitting a <strong>gastric balloon</strong> can usually be done without a surgeon making an incision. People should be able to leave hospital on the same day and be back to normal almost straight away.</p>
<p>After banding, bypass, or gastrectomy people need to have long-term regular check-ups, including blood tests. For the first few months after surgery people may have symptoms, such as tiredness and aching, as the body gets used to losing a lot of weight quickly.</p>
<p>People who have surgery will need to follow a strict eating plan for eight weeks after their operation. After that, they need to follow a long-term sensible diet plan. They may have to take some supplements (vitamins and minerals) for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>If, some months after surgery, someone has a lot of loose skin after losing a lot of weight, they may decide they want cosmetic surgery to remove it. This can be expensive because the treatment is not available on the NHS.</p></div>
