<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Losing weight (if you are overweight)</li>
<li>Taking more exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to lose weight, you will need to change your diet to include fewer calories, and take exercise to burn off excess calories. Your doctor or practice nurse may be able to help you make a weight loss plan. You could also try a commercial weight-loss organisation such as Weight Watchers.</p>
<p>Exercise can include swimming, using the gym, walking, gardening, or any activity that keeps you active.</p>
<p>Some people benefit from self-help support programmes, which use talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). These programmes can help people feel more in control of their arthritis, by learning to manage their pain, exercise and keep active safely, solve problems, reduce anxiety and keep healthy.</p>
<p>Programmes can be given in groups or individually, by healthcare professionals or by other patients. These programmes can be an addition to other treatments such as pain medication or physical management, or can be tried before other treatments.</p></div>

<p>Pain medications are drug treatments designed to offer pain relief. Some can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription, while others need to be prescribed by a doctor. They come in different formulations - tablets, gels or creams, and injections.</p>
<p><strong>Over-the-counter:</strong> medicines you can buy without a prescription include paracetamol, paracetamol combined with low-dose codeine, and some <dfn>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&nbsp;</dfn>(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen in a low dose. NSAIDs come as tablets (called oral NSAIDs) and as gels you rub on the skin (called topical NSAIDs). <br /><br /><strong>Prescription medicines:</strong> these include higher-dose NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors and higher-dose <dfn>opioid medicines</dfn>, such as codeine.</p>
<p><dfn><strong>Corticosteroid</strong></dfn><strong> injections into the hip joint:</strong>&nbsp;injections of corticosteroids into the joint have to be done by doctors, physiotherapists or nurse specialists. Because injections are used as a short-term treatment, you usually shouldn't have&nbsp;more than three injections in a joint per year.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-11">11</span>]<span id="reference-11" class="content-reference">British National Formulary 61, Section 10.

<p>NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and COX-2 inhibitors, can cause bleeding in the stomach when taken over a long period of time. They can also raise the risk of heart attacks and stroke, although this risk is relatively low. NSAID tablets may not be suitable for people with certain conditions, such as asthma, a peptic ulcer, or angina, or if you&nbsp;have had a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Opioids, like codeine and tramadol, can help relieve severe pain, but they can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, and constipation. You may need to take a laxative to treat constipation.</p>
<p>Tramadol is not suitable if you have epilepsy, and dihydrocodeine is not recommended for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pregnant women should not take any opioids.</p>
<p>If you take opioid painkillers regularly, you risk becoming addicted to them.</p>
<p>Corticosteroid injections could cause an infection in the joint. Repeated injections could damage the cartilage in your joint. You usually have only two or three injections a year because of this risk. Other side effects include discomfort or swelling at the injection site, a brief worsening of your arthritis pain, and a redness in your face (flushing) soon after the injection.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-11">11</span>]<span id="reference-11" class="content-reference">British National Formulary 61, Section 10.

<p><strong>Acupuncture:</strong> involves treatment with needles. Usually, about six needles are placed around the painful area and sometimes in other areas as well. A course of treatment usually consists of six or more sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy:</strong> uses essential plant oils as a therapy. The oils may be applied directly to the skin or release an aroma that is inhaled.</p>
<p><strong>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS):</strong> a type of electrotherapy that can be used at home. With TENS, an electrode is applied to the skin at varying intervals as required.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary supplements:</strong> Glucosamine and chondroitin are similar to natural substances that form cartilage in the body. They can be bought from pharmacies in the UK. Glucosamine is available in two forms: glucosamine hydrochloride and glucosamine sulphate. Chondroitin is available in the form of chondroitin sulphate.</p></div>

Surgery is usually for people who have severe symptoms and have tried other treatments without success. You may wish to consider surgery if: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You are in constant pain</li>
<li>You have severe pain in your hip that stops you from sleeping</li>
<li>Your independence is reduced because you can't do everyday things for yourself, like getting in and out of the bath or tying your own shoelaces</li>
<li>The pain and problems you have in getting around and doing everyday things are making you depressed</li>
<li>You can no longer do things that you used to do, like going out in the car to see friends or family</li>
<li>You have a job but the pain in your hip is stopping you from working.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to rush into a decision about surgery. Arthritis usually gets worse quite slowly, so you have time to decide what you want to do. Not everyone finds that their pain gets worse, and some people manage to live with it. But if you have symptoms that are stopping you from enjoying life, you may wish to think about having surgery before any disability you may have gets worse.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering surgery, you&rsquo;ll need to see an <dfn>orthopaedic&nbsp;</dfn>surgeon for a clinical examination and assessment, along with an x-ray if you&rsquo;ve not already had one. The surgeon will look at the damage to your joint and consider which type of operation and artificial joint is best, along with discussing what expectations you have of surgery.</p>
<p>The majority of people with hip osteoarthritis will not be suitable for resurfacing. It is most often used for younger people.</p>
<p>You may also have an <dfn>anaesthetic</dfn> assessment before surgery. The anaesthetist will ask about your general fitness and consider whether a general anaesthetic (where you are asleep during surgery) or a <dfn>nerve block</dfn> (where you are awake during surgery, but don&rsquo;t feel any pain) is better for you.&nbsp;</p></div>

                                            <p>This decision aid is to help you decide which treatments you choose for osteoarthritis of the hip. There are several types of treatment available.&nbsp;You can try different treatments, either together or separately. The choice you make may depend on many things, including how much your osteoarthritis bothers you, how active you want to be, how long you've had osteoarthritis and which treatments you have already tried. Not all the options are suitable for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can combine different treatments. The options for treatment are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong>, including weight loss and exercise</li>
<li><strong>Physical management</strong>, including physiotherapy and occupational therapy</li>
<li><strong>Treatments to manage pain</strong>, including tablets you take by mouth, injections into the joint and self-help support.</li>
<li><strong>Complementary treatments</strong>, including acupuncture and nutritional supplements</li>
<li><strong>Surgery</strong>, including hip resurfacing and total hip replacement. Surgery is usually for people with severe symptoms who have tried other treatments first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decisions people with osteoarthritis are making include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've just been diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis. Will I need medication or physical management, or should I try lifestyle changes first?</li>
<li>My hip pain is worsening. Should I try different treatments to the ones I have tried already?</li>
<li>I've tried other treatments, but my hip pain still&nbsp;interferes with my life. Is it time to consider having surgery?</li>
<li>I don't want to have surgery now. Should I try pain management treatments and physical management?</li>
</ul>
<p>The right choice for you may change over time. This decision aid aims to help you make the right choice for you now, but you may want to change to a different option in future.</p>                    </div>

<p>The top part of the thigh bone is shaped like a ball, and the bottom of the hip joint is shaped like a cup or socket. The way these bones fit together allows a lot of movement at your hip joint. This movement allows you to do things like sit cross-legged, run, kick a ball, and climb stairs.</p>
<p>A smooth material called cartilage covers the bones where they meet and rub together. This protective coating absorbs shock. It allows the bones to slide over each other effortlessly when the joint moves.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="2_1_further-info_9"><p>Osteoarthritis is a condition of the joints. As we age, the smooth <dfn>cartilage</dfn> at the ends of bones can become rough and damaged. Osteoarthritis happens when the damage is worse than it is with normal wear and tear. This can cause pain and stiffness in the joint. It limits the movement of the hip where the bones meet.</p>
<p>Over time, the cartilage can wear away completely. The bone in your joints grows and tries to repair the damage. This bone growth happens faster than it usually would. In places, the bone forms growths called bone spurs. Bone spurs can change the shape of joints, which means they can't move as well as they should.</p>
<p>The result is that your hip joint may feel stiff and painful to move. You may not be able to move it as freely as you did before.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>Pain, especially when walking&nbsp;</li>
<li>Stiffness in the morning, which improves soon after you start to move (within half an hour)</li>
<li>Difficulty moving your affected joints.</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms mean you may find it difficult to do things you used to take for granted. People with osteoarthritis of the hip often find it hard to put their shoes and socks on or to get in and out of a car.</p>
<p>Most people with hip osteoarthritis feel pain in the groin or outside the hip, which is worse when they move the hip. For some people, the brain will identify pain in the knee and not in the hip, because of the &lsquo;wiring&rsquo; that transmits the pain signals. In most cases, pain will be at its worst when you walk, although it can also affect you when you are resting.</p></div>

<p>An x-ray may show bone spurs, loss of cartilage, and other signs of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The signs of arthritis on the x-ray have little to do with how bad your arthritis feels. Some people with little pain have lots of signs of arthritis on the x-ray, while other people with more pain have fewer signs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the choices you make about treatment should depend on how you feel about your arthritis rather than the results of an x-ray.</p>
<p>Your other hip, your knees, spine, or arms may have some arthritis in them as well and this can affect which treatment will help you most. When you have tests for arthritis, it&rsquo;s important to let your doctors know about problems that you might have in other joints, as well as any other health problems.</p></div>

<p>Many people have osteoarthritis in their joints but do not realise it because they do not have any symptoms. They do not have any pain or any difficulty in moving their joints.</p>
<p>If you looked at x-ray pictures of most people over the age of 65, you would find that around two-thirds of them have signs of osteoarthritis, but less than half of those with the signs would have any symptoms. And only about half the people with x-rays showing severe osteoarthritis would have symptoms.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-32">32</span>]<span id="reference-32" class="content-reference">Felson DT.
