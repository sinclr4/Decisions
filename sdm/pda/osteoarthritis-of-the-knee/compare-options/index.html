<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Hours Of Operation</p>
<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

<p>Sometimes osteoarthritis causes bone spurs&nbsp;(also known as osteophytes) to grow on the inside of the knee. Bone spurs rub against the knee bones. This can be painful.</p>

<li>Stiffness, especially in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, your knees may 'give way' beneath you or make it difficult to straighten your legs. You may also hear a soft, grating sound when you move the affected joint.</p>

<p>Sometimes you need blood tests or scans to rule out other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>The signs of arthritis on the x-ray have little to do with how bad your arthritis feels. Some people with little pain have lots of signs of arthritis on the x-ray, while other people with more pain have fewer signs.</p>

<p>Pain medications&nbsp;are drug treatments designed to offer pain relief. Some can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription, while others need to be prescribed by a doctor. They come in different formulations - tablets, gels or creams, and injections.</p>
<p><strong>Over-the-counter tablets:</strong> You can buy paracetamol, paracetamol combined with low-dose codeine, and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&nbsp;(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac in a low dose, without a prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Over-the counter gels or creams</strong>: You can buy gels and creams containing painkillers such as ibuprofen and diclofenac without a prescription. <br /> <br /> <strong>Prescription medicines: </strong>These include higher-dose and more potent NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors (often called coxibs). Opioid medicines like codeine, tramadol, and dihydrocodeine may be used if NSAIDs don&rsquo;t work well enough. Capsaicin cream, which is made from chilli peppers, produces a burning sensation at first but may reduce the pain in the joint.</p>
<p><strong>Steroid injections:&nbsp;</strong>Steroids can be injected directly into the knee joint to provide pain relief for people who have a flare-up of bad pain. They are not used as a long-term treatment.</p>
<p>Some people benefit from&nbsp;<strong>self-help support programmes</strong>, which use talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). These programmes can help people feel more in control of their arthritis, by learning to manage their pain, exercise and keep active safely, solve problems, reduce anxiety and keep healthy.</p>
<p>Programmes can be given in groups or individually, by healthcare professionals or by other patients. These programmes can be an addition to other treatments such as pain medication or physical management, or can be tried before other treatments.</p></div>

Two or three surfaces can be replaced, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bottom of your thigh bone</li>
<li>The top of your shin bone</li>
<li>The back of your kneecap.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of knee replacement. A&nbsp;<strong>total knee replacement</strong>&nbsp;resurfaces your whole knee. A&nbsp;<strong>partial knee replacement</strong> or <strong>partial knee resurfacing</strong> resurfaces only the inner or outer half of your knee, so less of your original bone is removed. Partial knee replacements only work for people with arthritis in one half of the knee (which for most people is the inner half, nearest your other leg).</p>
<p>Knee replacement surgery takes 60 minutes to 90 minutes. You'll be given either a&nbsp;general anaesthetic&nbsp;(a drug that puts you to sleep) or an&nbsp;epidural&nbsp;(an injection into your spine). If you have an epidural, the lower part of your body will be numb. You won't be able to see the surgery but you will be able to hear what's going on.</p>
<p><strong>Arthroscopy</strong> can be used to examine and treat the inside of the knee joint. You'll usually be given a general anaesthetic. Your surgeon makes small cuts into the knee joint. A thin tube with a camera is put through one of the cuts to examine the joint. Fluid can be flushed through one of the other cuts to wash out the joint. This is called <strong>arthroscopic lavage</strong>. Small surgical instruments can remove damaged tissue at the same time. This is called <strong>debridement</strong>. At the end of the procedure the excess fluid is drained out of the joint and the cuts are closed with stitches.</p></div>

<p>All operations have risks and your surgeon should talk these through with you before you have your knee replaced. You may have an&nbsp;allergic reaction&nbsp;to the anaesthetic or get breathing problems or heart problems. These are rare but serious. If you have any&nbsp;allergies&nbsp;you must tell your doctor, because having allergies makes an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic more likely. Your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing will be closely monitored during surgery to make sure you are safe.</p>
<p>Most (9 in 10) serious problems happen within four days of knee replacement, while people are still in hospital.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-72">72</span>]<span id="reference-72" class="content-reference">Parvizi J, Mui A, Purtill JJ, et al.

<p><strong>Problems that can happen during or soon after knee replacement<br /></strong></p>

In most people, the clot causes no trouble, and they never know they've had one. Some people get symptoms and need treatment with&nbsp;<strong>blood-thinning drugs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting a blood clot in your lungs</strong>: Part of a blood clot in your leg can travel in your bloodstream to your lungs. In a small number of cases, this can be fatal.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-74">74</span>]<span id="reference-74" class="content-reference">Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures.

Available at http://www.surgeons.org/media/19249/UKAreview0605.pdf (accessed on 25 June 2012.)</span>&nbsp;A blood clot in the lungs happens to about <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Knee-Arthritis/1-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">1 in 100</a> people having knee replacement.</p>
<p>To help prevent blood clots in your legs or lungs, you will probably be given elastic stockings to wear after your operation. They keep the blood flowing in your legs. You may also get small doses of blood-thinning drugs during your stay in hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Damage to the nerves in your leg</strong>: During a knee replacement operation, nerves in your leg can be hurt. But it's rare. Nerve damage causes numbness and tingling in your leg. It can also weaken your ankle or foot. Most people make a full recovery.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-75">75</span>]<span id="reference-75" class="content-reference">Schinsky MF, Macaulay W, Parks ML, et al. Nerve injury after primary total knee arthroplasty. Journal of Arthroplasty. 2001; 16: 1048-1054.</span></p>
<p><strong>Wound infection</strong>: The skin and tissue underneath the wound can get red and sore. If this happens, you may have an infected wound that needs antibiotics. Wound infections can be a problem because they can spread to infect the knee replacement. In some cases, another operation may be needed to clean out the joint. In the most serious cases, an operation may be needed to remove the replacement. We don't know how common infections are after a knee replacement. Infection could also happen after arthroscopy.</p>
<p><strong>Problems that can happen months or years after knee replacement<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Your knee gives way or buckles</strong>: Doctors call this&nbsp;<strong>instability</strong>. It's painful and can interfere with your daily life. If your knee starts to give way, you may need a second operation to make it more stable. Or you may need another knee replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Your new leg may be shorter than the other</strong>: This is rare.</p>
<p><strong>You have problems bending the knee.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need a second knee replacement</strong>: About <span class="image-reference"><a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Knee-Arthritis/1-in-100.jpg" class="image-reference">1 in 100</a></span> people need a second operation five years after the first knee replacement.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-76">76</span>]<span id="reference-76" class="content-reference">Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures.

Available at http://www.surgeons.org/media/19249/UKAreview0605.pdf (accessed on 25 June 2012).</span> Most repeat operations are done because the first knee worked loose from the bone. This can happen over time. Second operations are harder for the surgeon, take longer, and are more likely to go wrong than first operations.</p>
<p><strong>Your knee joint gets infected</strong>: Very rarely, new knees can get infected months or years after surgery. Your knee may get better with antibiotics, but you may need another operation to clean out the joint.</p></div>

<p>The rehabilitation process after <strong>knee replacement</strong> surgery requires commitment. You will need to follow an exercise programme to strengthen your knee.</p>
<p>The benefits of knee replacement should last for at least five years. They may last for longer but the research studies usually only follow up people for five years. One review of the research looked at about 10,000 people who had a knee replacement operation. Five years after their operation, 9 in 10 of them rated their lack of pain and ease of movement as "good" or "excellent".[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-55">55</span>]<span id="reference-55" class="content-reference">Callahan CM, Drake BG, Heck DA, et al.

                <p><strong>Surgery</strong></p>
                <p>You will need to stay in hospital for three to five days after knee replacement surgery. For the first three to six weeks after the operation you will need a walking aid, such as crutches, to help support you. Most people can get back to their normal activities within two to three months.&nbsp; Some people might need up to six months.</p>
<p>After arthroscopy to wash out the joint and remove damaged tissue you will normally be able to go home once you have recovered from the anaesthetic. You may have to rest with the leg raised for a short period, and you will need crutches at first to help support you when walking. It may take up to three weeks before you can use your knee normally.</p>                                    <a href="#option-257-further-info" class="popup stick-to-bottom std-link" title="View further information about Surgery in a pop up window">more information</a>
