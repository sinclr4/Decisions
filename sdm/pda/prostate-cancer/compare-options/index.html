<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes this process breaks down. New cells form&nbsp;rapidly, when the body doesn't need them, and old cells don't die when they should.</p>
<p>In prostate cancer, some of the cells in the prostate gland start to grow out of control, invading and destroying healthy cells. The extra cells can form a mass of tissue called a cancer, growth, or tumour.</p>

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and treatment. Clinical guideline 58. February 2008. Available at: http://www.nice.org.uk/CG58 (accessed on 22 August 2012).</span> If you have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, you will probably have had all of these tests already. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital rectal examination (DRE), during which your doctor uses a gloved, lubricated finger to examine&nbsp;your prostate via your back passage (rectum).</li>
<li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, a measure of the level of PSA circulating in the blood. PSA is a protein that is only produced by the prostate.</li>
<li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&nbsp;a scan that produces clear images of your prostate. It uses magnetic waves, not x-rays.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A needle biopsy guided by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS),&nbsp;tissue samples taken by inserting small needles into the prostate gland.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tests might not have been performed in this order.&nbsp;<span>You won't be diagnosed with prostate cancer until you have had at least a PSA test, a digital rectal exam, and a biopsy.</span></p>
<p>You and your doctor may have decided on these tests because you have a family member who has prostate cancer, or because you were worried that something was wrong with your prostate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>High PSA levels may suggest you&nbsp;have prostate cancer, but there are other possible explanations.&nbsp;A needle biopsy guided by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) is needed to confirm prostate cancer.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>The results from the&nbsp;needle biopsy are also used to classify your prostate cancer as low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk.&nbsp;This patient decision aid is for men with low-risk or intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer that hasn't spread to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low risk:</strong>&nbsp;the cancer is very unlikely to grow or spread within the next ten years.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate risk:</strong>&nbsp;the cancer is unlikely to grow or spread for several years.</li>
<li><strong>High risk:</strong>&nbsp;the cancer may grow or spread within a few years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The risk group is calculated by combining results from the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, the Gleason score, and the stage of the cancer (the TNM score). This decision aid is only about low-risk and intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The method used to classify your risk group is not perfect. Some men who at first are thought to have a low-risk localised prostate cancer will later be found to have a higher risk cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PSA test</strong>: The higher the PSA level in your blood, the more likely it is that cancer is present.</p>
<p><strong>Gleason score</strong>: This is calculated by looking at samples of prostate cells taken in a biopsy. A pathologist will look for different grades of prostate cancer in the biopsy samples. The lowest grade is usually 3, and the highest is 5. The two main grades are then added together to give the Gleason score. The higher the Gleason score, the more likely the cancer is to spread.</p>
<p>As an example, men with low-risk localised prostate cancer will have a Gleason score of 6 (3 + 3).</p>
<p>Men with intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer have a Gleason score of 7 and might be graded 3 + 4 or 4 + 3. The order is important. The first number refers to the grade of the cancer cells that appear most commonly in your biopsy, and the second number to the cancer cells found less commonly.&nbsp;When the first number - called the primary cancer grade - is 3, it means that the cancer is likely to grow more slowly (be less aggressive) than a primary cancer grade of 4. Ask your doctor for your Gleason score and for a breakdown of the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>TNM score</strong>: The TNM score describes the stage of your cancer. It uses results from the digital rectal examination (DRE) and sometimes an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to classify prostate cancer. The TNM score can tell you and your doctor:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big your cancer is and whether it has spread outside the prostate (<strong>T</strong> for tumour)</li>
<li>Whether your prostate cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (<strong>N</strong> for nodes)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whether your prostate cancer has spread to other areas of your body, such as your hip bones (<strong>M</strong> for metastasis). &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>T1 prostate cancers are very small and completely inside the prostate. They cannot be found by digital rectal examination.&nbsp;T2 prostate cancers are larger, but still within the prostate. Your doctor might feel the cancer as a hard area or lump during a digital rectal examination.&nbsp;</p>

                <div data-cms-content-id="100_1_further-info_470"><p>Your prostate cancer has been diagnosed at an early stage. It&rsquo;s localised, which means that it hasn&rsquo;t spread beyond your prostate. If you have low-risk prostate cancer there&rsquo;s a good chance that you will live just as long as someone who doesn&rsquo;t have prostate cancer.&nbsp;Even without treatment.</p>
<p>But many men will want to have their prostate cancer treated or managed in some way. There are treatments that aim to cure your cancer (for example, surgery to remove your prostate or radiotherapy) and others that may improve your symptoms (like hormone therapy).</p>
<p>The choices you make will depend on&nbsp;many things. These may include the risk of the cancer growing or spreading, your likely life expectancy,&nbsp;your general health, the benefits and side effects of different treatments, and your personal values and preferences.</p>
<p>If you are older and have other serious medical problems, then you may be more likely to die from one of your other problems than from prostate cancer. If you are younger, there&rsquo;s more time for the cancer to grow or spread so your chances of dying from prostate cancer are greater. Younger men are more likely to be offered treatments that can cure their cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some men may have difficulty&nbsp;passing urine, leak urine&nbsp;(incontinence), or have erection problems (impotence).&nbsp;These are some of the possible side effects of treatment,&nbsp;but they are also more common as men get older.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;unlikely to be caused by prostate cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prostate cancer becomes very difficult to cure when it spreads beyond the prostate. Treatments used to control the growth may help your chances of survival.</p>
<p>Sometimes prostate cancer can spread far beyond the prostate (called metastatic disease). It may spread to your bones, causing pain and broken bones. Men with metastatic disease may feel extremely tired, feel weak, and lose weight. About one third of men with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body will be alive after five years.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">Cancer Research UK.

<ul>
<li>About 64 in 100 men with <strong>low-risk</strong> cancer were still alive after 12 years. This compares with 42 in 100 men with <strong>intermediate-risk</strong> cancer</li>
<li>About 3 in 100 men with <strong>low-risk</strong> cancer died from their prostate cancer. This compares with 11 in 100 men with <strong>intermediate-risk</strong> cancer who died from their prostate cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only a small number of men died from their prostate cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefit of regular visits to your doctor seems to differ depending on whether you have been diagnosed with a low-risk or an intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer. Six monthly visits to the doctor seem to make a bigger difference for men with low-risk cancer than for men with intermediate-risk cancer.</p>
<p>Active surveillance involves frequent visits to your doctor and close monitoring with tests. So it&rsquo;s likely to be at least as good as visiting your doctor once every six months to have your prostate cancer checked.</p></div>

<p>Difficulty passing urine,&nbsp;leaking urine (incontinence), and erection problems (impotence) can happen in men having active surveillance.&nbsp;These effects aren't caused by active surveillance.

<p>Active surveillance does not suit everyone. It delays treatment until tests show that your cancer is growing. Some men are comfortable with this. But others might not be happy living with an untreated cancer. They are more likely to want a treatment that aims to cure their cancer soon after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Like watchful waiting, there are no pills or tablets to remember. There&rsquo;s no treatment right away. So active surveillance won&rsquo;t physically affect you as much as treatments like radiotherapy or surgery. You will still have to visit your doctor regularly. They will want to know your PSA levels and might also recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or needle biopsies. You will need to go to hospital to have an MRI scan or a&nbsp;needle biopsy.</p>
<p>Many men and their partners will find the prospect of erection problems upsetting. Some men find other ways to get sexual satisfaction or try treatments, including pills or vacuum pumps, that may help them to get an erection. If you have treatment, your ability to get an erection may improve with time.</p>

<p>A machine positioned above the body directs the radiation through the abdomen and into the cells in the prostate. The aim of the treatment is to kill the cancer cells in the prostate so that the cancer can&rsquo;t grow and spread to other parts of the body. The radiation dose needed to kill the cancer cells is much higher than the dose used for x-ray images.</p>
<p>Men having radiotherapy are outpatients, and are treated with 20 to 38 doses of radiation, called fractions. Each session lasts a few minutes. Treatment takes place once a day, for five days a week. A course of treatment lasts between four&nbsp;and seven weeks.</p>
<p>You will have a PSA test about six or 12 weeks after your radiotherapy finishes.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-22">22</span>]<span id="reference-22" class="content-reference">Prostate Cancer UK.

<p>Low-dose rate brachytherapy involves planting very small radioactive &lsquo;seeds&rsquo; directly in or near the cancer in your prostate. The aim is to target and destroy the cancer cells while sparing the healthy cells.</p>
<p>The seeds are planted when you are under a general anaesthetic or a spinal anaesthetic (an injection into the small of your back that numbs nerves from the waist down for several hours). The procedure takes between one and one-and-a-half hours. Most men can go home on the same day.</p>
<p>You will not feel the seeds once they have been planted in your prostate. The radiation is released slowly by the seeds and fades away after a few months. The seeds will remain in your body for the rest of your life, even after the radiation has worn off.</p>
<p>Most hospitals will check your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level six to 12 weeks after your low-dose rate brachytherapy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-35">35</span>]<span id="reference-35" class="content-reference">The Prostate Cancer Charity.

<p>Low-dose rate brachytherapy can cause painful and bloody bowel movements. But it&rsquo;s not clear how often these typically happen or for how long they typically last.</p>

<p>Many men and their partners will find the prospect of erection problems upsetting. Some men find other ways to get sexual satisfaction or try treatments, including pills or vacuum pumps, that may help them to get an erection.</p>
<p>Leakage of urine can affect confidence, relationships, and daily life. Some men will try to make sure that they&rsquo;re never too far from a toilet. Pads can be used to absorb leaking urine and may be available through the NHS. Other men may have to pay for incontinence pads themselves.</p>

<p>The surgery removes the prostate through a single cut in your abdomen (retropubic surgery) or through a cut in the skin between the anus&nbsp;and testicles (called perineal surgery). This type of operation is called open prostatectomy.</p>
<p>Keyhole surgery (laparoscopic surgery) can also be used to remove the prostate. This operation uses a series of small cuts (about 4 or 5) to reach and remove your prostate. Not all hospitals offer laparoscopic surgery.</p>
<p>You will have a general anaesthetic and will need a catheter after the operation. The catheter is inserted into your penis through the urethra and drains urine from the bladder. It&rsquo;s normally taken out one to two weeks after surgery.</p>
<p>The aim of radical prostatectomy is to cure you of cancer. In addition to removing the prostate, the surgeon will remove some of the healthy tissue around it and the tubes that carry semen (seminal vesicles).</p>
<p>Sometimes the edge of the healthy tissue contains some cancer cells (called a positive margin). This could mean - but not always - that a few cancer cells were left behind during surgery. You may be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells and help stop the cancer coming back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re likely to have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test about six&nbsp;weeks after surgery.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>The wall of your rectum (back passage) can be damaged during surgery, but this is uncommon. If certain nerves are damaged or removed during the operation then you may have problems getting erections. Men who had good erections before the operation may have fewer erection problems after surgery.&nbsp;Men who have a radical prostatectomy will have a dry climax (retrograde ejaculation). Dry climax may not affect how much you enjoy sex.</p>

<p>Many men and their partners may find the prospect of erection problems upsetting. Some men find other ways to get sexual satisfaction or try treatments, including pills or vacuum pumps, that can help them to get some erections.</p>
<p class="tablecontents">Incontinence can affect men&rsquo;s confidence, relationships, and daily life. Some will try to make sure that they&rsquo;re never too far from a toilet. Pads can be used to absorb leaking urine and may be available through the NHS. Other men may have to pay for incontinence pads themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some cancer cells may remain after radical prostatectomy or the cancer may have spread undetected to other parts of the body before surgery.&nbsp;So your risk of dying from prostate cancer, or prostate cancer that has spread, may be the same even though your prostate has been removed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some men will always wonder whether they really needed surgery. Before your operation, no one can say for sure how your prostate cancer might behave in the future. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and never cause symptoms or health problems, while others grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p></div>
