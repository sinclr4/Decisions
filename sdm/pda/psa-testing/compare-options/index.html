<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prostate specific antigen (PSA) test</strong>. This is a blood test that measures the amount of PSA circulating in the blood. PSA is a protein that is only produced by the prostate. If there is cancer in the prostate, more PSA gets into your blood from your prostate. Your PSA level is measured in units called nanograms (ng) per millilitre (ml) of blood. There are other causes of a raised PSA level. That&rsquo;s why a&nbsp;PSA test on its own cannot tell you for certain whether you have prostate cancer. It can only tell you if you have a raised risk of prostate cancer. If you have a raised PSA level you will need to have other tests to find out if this is caused by prostate cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Digital rectal examination (DRE)</strong>. A doctor will insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum (back passage) to feel the prostate gland. He or she may be able to tell if the prostate gland feels abnormal. This is more likely if the prostate has a tumour that is bigger than one inch, or three centimetres in size. Some men find this test uncomfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Rectal ultrasound scan</strong>. A small device is inserted into your back passage. It uses sound waves to create a clear picture of the prostate gland that a doctor can see on a computer screen. This can help to tell if there is a tumour in your prostate gland. Some men find this test uncomfortable.</li>
<li><strong>Biopsy</strong>. The aim of a biopsy is to find prostate&nbsp;cancers that could cause you health problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-7">7</span>]<span id="reference-7" class="content-reference">NICE. Prostate cancer. Diagnosis and treatment. Clinical Guideline 58. February 2008. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG58NICEGuideline.pdf (accessed 15 August 2012).</span> During a biopsy a doctor uses a needle to remove very small pieces of tissue from your prostate to look at under a microscope. This can show changes in the cells that are caused by prostate cancer. The needle will be either gently pushed through the wall of your rectum into the prostate or inserted into the skin between your scrotum (the sac that holds your testicles) and your anus (the opening through which you empty your bowels). The needle will be guided by a device called an ultrasound probe. Some men find this test uncomfortable or painful.</li>

<p><strong>If your PSA test shows you have normal PSA levels</strong></p>
<p>If your PSA level is healthy for your age, you are less likely to have prostate cancer. There is a chance that your PSA level will go up in future. If you have a normal PSA test result, doctors recommend that you do not need to have another test for at least two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PSA test doesn&rsquo;t always pick up prostate cancer. Around 15 in 100 men with a normal PSA level will have prostate cancer.

<p><strong>If your PSA test shows you have raised PSA levels</strong></p>

<p>If your PSA level is only slightly above what is considered normal for your age, you are less likely to have prostate cancer. There are other illnesses that can cause a slight increase in PSA levels, such as an enlarged prostate, prostatitis, or urinary infections.

<p>If your PSA level is much higher than what is considered normal for your age, it is more likely that this is a sign of cancer. But a PSA test on its own cannot tell you for certain whether you have prostate cancer. You will still need more tests to be certain.</p>
<p>Your GP will usually refer you to a specialist doctor called a urologist. The specialist will probably repeat the tests that your GP did, to check for any changes. They will discuss whether you should have another test, called a biopsy. This is the main test doctors use to tell if you have prostate cancer.</p></div>

<p><strong>Watchful waiting</strong></p>
<p>Some men decide not to have any further treatment for prostate cancer unless they start to have symptoms, or their symptoms start to get worse.</p>
<p><strong>Active surveillance</strong></p>
<p>This means having regular PSA tests and prostate biopsies to check how quickly the cancer is growing, or if it is causing other health problems. Men see a doctor for tests every three or six months. If the cancer starts to grow they can choose to have treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Hormone treatment (with drugs)</strong></p>
<p>Hormone treatment drugs block the action of the male sex hormone testosterone, which helps the prostate cancer to grow. This treatment is also called androgen deprivation and androgen suppression.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hormone treatment (with surgery)</strong></p>
<p>This involves an operation to remove your testicles. This permanently gets rid of your body&rsquo;s main source of testosterone. The aim is to stop the prostate cancer cells from growing and spreading.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Surgery</strong></p>
<p>This involves an operation to remove the prostate gland. The aim is to cure the cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>External beam radiotherapy&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is when a machine beams radiation into the tumour to kill the cancer cells.

<p>Brachytherapy uses radioactive metal 'seeds' or pellets that are placed directly into your prostate.

It measures the amount of a protein called prostate-specific antigen (or PSA) in your blood. PSA is made by the prostate gland. It is normally found in semen, the fluid which contains your sperm. If there is cancer in the prostate, more PSA leaks into the blood.</p>
<p>Your GP can take a blood sample to be tested for PSA. Your test result will show the level of PSA in a measurement of nanograms (ng) per millilitre (mL) of blood. The higher the level of PSA, the more likely it is to be a sign of cancer.</p>
<p>A PSA test on its own cannot tell you for certain whether you have prostate cancer. It can only tell you if you have a raised risk of prostate cancer. Other illnesses which are not cancer (such as an enlarged prostate, prostatitis, and urinary infections) can also cause a rise in PSA.&nbsp;If you have a raised PSA level you will need to have other tests to find out if this is caused by prostate cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSA levels can vary between men of the same age. Doctors use the following cut-offs to help decide what is a healthy PSA level:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PSA level below 3.0ng/ml is considered healthy if you are aged between 50 and 59&nbsp;</li>
<li>A PSA level below 4.0ng/ml is considered healthy if you are aged between 60 and 69&nbsp;</li>
<li>A PSA level below 5.0ng/ml is considered healthy if you are aged 70 or older.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a PSA level higher than is considered healthy for your age, you will need other tests to find out if this is caused by prostate cancer.</p></div>

<p>The test itself is unlikely to have an effect, but the results of the test could affect your quality of life. If you have a positive result, your quality of life could be affected by worry about cancer, and by the tests and treatments you may need as a result.

<p>Your doctor will recommend you have another PSA test, a digital rectal examination, or a biopsy. A PSA test and a digital rectal examination can both be done by your GP. You will need to go to hospital to have a biopsy. Most men don&rsquo;t need to stay in hospital overnight.</p>
<p>Your doctor may also suggest you have a transrectal ultrasound. If so, this can often be done at the same time as a biopsy. You will need to go to hospital. Most men don&rsquo;t need to stay in hospital overnight.</p>
<p>If you have a raised PSA level, and further tests show this is caused by prostate cancer, you will need to decide whether to have treatment. It&rsquo;s likely that you will need to spend time in hospital if you choose to have treatment. (For more, see the Patient Decision Aid on localised prostate cancer.) Treatments for prostate cancer are likely to have side effects.&nbsp;</p>
