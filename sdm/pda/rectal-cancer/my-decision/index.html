<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>

<p>The walls of the colon and rectum are made up of layers. The inner layer is called the mucosa. This is the layer next to where food waste passes. It is from cells in the mucosa that cancer usually starts.</p>
<p>The waste from food passes through the colon into the rectum. The colon and&nbsp;rectum are covered with muscles. They automatically tighten and relax to push food from the stomach through to the rectum. The food waste leaves the body through an opening called the anus.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="323_1_further-info_1412"><p>Rectal cancer is cancer that starts in the rectum (the end of the colon furthest from the stomach).</p>
<p>The inner lining of the bowel is a thin layer of cells called the mucosa. Cells in this lining have a short life. They grow, divide in two, then die and get replaced. Your body controls this activity so that cells are replaced every five days or so.</p>
<p>But sometimes things go wrong. Cells keep dividing when they don't need to, and old ones don't die. If this happens, you can get a cluster of extra cells called a tumour. Some tumours are made up of normal cells. These are not dangerous. Doctors call them benign tumours or polyps. They stay put and don't cause any problems. But other tumours are made up of cancer cells. Doctors call these malignant tumours. Rectal cancer&nbsp;happens when a malignant tumour starts to grow in the rectum.</p>
<p>Cells in rectal tumours can break away and move to other parts of your body. These breakaway cells are carried in your bloodstream or in your lymphatic system. This is a network of tubes and small collections of cells called lymph nodes that helps the body fight off disease.</p>
<p>When the cancer cells arrive at a different part of your body, they can start growing into another tumour. When cancer spreads like this, it's called metastasis. <strong>This Patient Decision Aid is for people who have rectal cancer that hasn't spread to any other part of the body, other than the rectum or nearby lymph nodes.</strong></p>
<p>If you have rectal cancer, your doctor will need to find out how big your cancer is and whether it has spread (metastasised). This is called staging your cancer and helps help doctors recommend which treatment might be most suitable for you. Your specialist is likely to arrange for you to have one or more additional tests:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<ul>
<li><strong>CT scan</strong>: this uses computerised x-rays to build a three-dimensional picture of the organs and tissues inside your abdomen (tummy). It can show how big the tumour is and whether it has spread outside your bowel, for example to your liver or lungs.</li>
<li><strong>MRI scan</strong>: this uses a magnetic field to get very detailed pictures of the inside of your body and show whether the cancer has spread. It can help show what stage the cancer is and whether you might benefit from treatment such as radiotherapy.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-2">2</span>]<span id="reference-2" class="content-reference">MERCURY study group.

<ul>
<li>A stage 0 cancer has abnormal cells in a layer of the wall of the rectum called the mucosa. The abnormal cells are in the mucosa only. These abnormal cells are not a cancer, but may become cancer and spread to other parts of the body. Stage 0 cancer is also called <strong>carcinoma in situ</strong>.</li>
<li>A stage 1 cancer has moved through the inner layers of the bowel and may also have spread to the thick muscle layer of the bowel wall, but not to the lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.</li>
<li>A stage 2 cancer has spread through the thick muscle layer of the bowel wall, but not to the lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.</li>
<li>A stage 3 cancer has spread through the thick muscle layer of the bowel wall and also to the lymph nodes.</li>
<li>A stage 4 cancer has spread through the thick muscle layer of the bowel wall to other parts of the body and possibly to the lymph nodes.</li>

                <div data-cms-content-id="323_1_further-info_1415"><p>It's best to see your GP if you have any bowel problems or symptoms that are worrying you. Don't wait to see if your symptoms go away. They may not be cancer, but if so it's important to rule out cancer as a cause. If you delay getting symptoms checked out, and you do have cancer, the cancer might be more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. This makes it harder to cure.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms that your GP suspects are rectal cancer, he or she is likely to ask you some questions about your symptoms, such as how long they have bothered you and when you notice them, and some questions about your general health. The GP is also likely to give you a physical exam to feel gently&nbsp;for swelling around your stomach or in your abdomen, and putting a gloved finger into your back passage (rectum) to feel for any lumps that could be cancerous.</p>
<p>Your GP&nbsp;may also give you&nbsp;a <strong>blood test</strong> to check for anaemia. If you are bleeding inside from a tumour or for another reason, you can become anaemic. This is when you feel tired and look pale. It happens because you don't have enough red blood cells in your body.</p>
<p>If your GP thinks that you could have cancer, he or she should refer you urgently to a hospital consultant or specialist clinic. You should get an appointment within two weeks of going to the GP.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-12">12</span>]<span id="reference-12" class="content-reference">Department of Health.

Most people who see a bowel specialist, including many of those who see one urgently, don't have cancer.

<p>There are different types of endoscopy. It's most likely you will have an endoscopy called a <strong>colonoscopy</strong>, which examines your entire large bowel.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>If you are not able to have a colonoscopy, your specialist is likely to suggest you have a different type of endoscopy to look at the rest of your bowel. This is usually a test&nbsp;called <strong>flexible sigmoidoscopy</strong>, which examines just the last third of your large bowel.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<p>If you have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, you will also need to have another test to show the rest of your rectum. This may be a type of scan called a <strong>CT scan</strong> or a type of x-ray called a <strong>barium enema</strong>.</p>
<p>During the endoscopy, your doctor is also likely to take a small sample of any growths or other abnormal tissue that he or she finds in your colon or rectum.

<p>The two types of major surgery for rectal cancer included in this Patient Decision Aid are anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection.</p>
<p>In <strong>anterior resection</strong>, a surgeon makes&nbsp;cuts in your abdomen and then removes the part of your rectum containing the tumour, along with nearby lymph nodes and tissue on either side of the tumour. He or she will then join your colon to the remaining part of the rectum so that, after the operation, you will pass stools in the usual way. Sometimes, to give the area time to heal, you may need to have a <strong>loop</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ileostomy</strong>. This is where the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, is&nbsp;brought out through an opening in the skin of your abdomen. Usually this can be reversed, and the intestines reconnected, by having a small procedure around eight weeks later. In the meantime, you wear a stoma bag over the stoma to collect your stools.</p>
<p>In <strong>abdominoperineal resection</strong> the surgeon makes cuts in the abdomen, and another in the area around the anus. This allows the surgeon to remove the part of the rectum around the anus (back passage) and the tissues surrounding it, including the sphincter muscle (a ring of muscle around the end of your rectum). After you have your rectum removed in this way, you will need a way to pass your stools out of the body. This is called a colostomy. A surgeon stitches the end of your colon to an opening in the skin of your abdomen called a stoma. Your stools then pass through the stoma into an ileostomy bag. This is permanent.</p>
<p>Both anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection can be done in one of two ways. <strong>Keyhole surgery</strong> (also called <strong>laparoscopy</strong>) removes the tumour by making several small cuts and one slightly larger cut in your abdomen.&nbsp;<strong>Open surgery</strong> involves taking out the tumour through one large cut in your abdomen.&nbsp;Both types of operation work equally well at stopping rectal cancer from returning.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-26">26</span>]<span id="reference-26" class="content-reference">Jackson TD, Kaplan GG, Arena G, et al. Laparoscopic versus open resection for colorectal cancer: a metaanalysis of oncologic outcomes. Journal of the American College of Surgeons. 2007; 204: 439-446.</span></p>
<p>Before your operation, you may also have radiotherapy or a combination of radiotherapy with chemotherapy. This is done to shrink the cancer before removing it. It is called neo-adjuvant treatment. Whether you need neo-adjuvant treatment depends on whether there is a high chance that your cancer might come back after your operation.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

<li>Both anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection affect your overall quality of life, your health, and how your health makes you feel, by about the same amount.</li>
<li>After their operation, people who had anterior resection were more able to do physical things than people who had abdominoperineal resection.

<p>Having chemotherapy or radiotherapy may affect how likely you are to have complications after major surgery for rectal cancer. Here's what we know from studies:</p>

<p>Depending on the operation you've had, you will probably be ready to go home after about two weeks. You will usually have an appointment between three and six weeks after your operation.

<p>Having major surgery for rectal cancer can mean you need a colostomy or a loop&nbsp;ileostomy so that your stools can be collected in a colostomy bag. If you have a colostomy or a loop&nbsp;ileostomy you will need to have a stoma (an opening in the skin of your abdomen that stools can pass through into a ileostomy bag). A colostomy or a loop&nbsp;ileostomy can either be temporary or permanent.</p>

<p>Having a colostomy should not stop you doing anything you used to do. But you will have to change your routine and get used to changing the bag that collects your bowel movements. You'll get plenty of help adjusting to having a colostomy from your local hospital team who are looking after you, a stoma nurse, or a local colostomy support group. Having a colostomy should not make any difference to your job unless your work involves heavy digging, or other kinds of manual work. If you are not sure about this, ask your stoma nurse for advice.</p>
<p>Major surgery for rectal cancer can affect your sex life. If you are a man, abdominoperineal resection may stop your erections, affect your ability to reach orgasm, or make your orgasms less pleasurable. If you already had some sexual problems before having treatment, abdominoperineal resection may make these worse. If you are a woman, major surgery for rectal cancer can cause scar tissue in the abdomen that may sometimes cause pain or discomfort during sex.</p>
<p>In men, abdominoperineal resection can damage the nerves that control ejaculation leading to dry orgasms (orgasms without semen). Sometimes this surgery causes retrograde ejaculation, which means the semen goes backward into the bladder during an orgasm. This can affect your fertility and whether you can father a child.</p></div>

<p>Local removal is also known as local resection. During the operation, your surgeon inserts instruments into your anus (back passage) to remove the cancer in your rectum.</p>
<p>The two types of local resection we consider in this Patient Decision Aid are called transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM or TEMS) and local transanal resection.</p>
<p><strong>Transanal resection</strong> (also known as transanal excision) is done with instruments inserted through the anus. Your surgeon will examine your bowel, and find the exact location of the tumour. During this operation a surgeon cuts through all layers of the rectum to remove cancer as well as some surrounding normal rectal tissue, and then closes the opening in the rectal wall. It is usually done with general anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep during the operation. Occasionally a surgeon will use a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area being operated on so you don't feel pain.</p>
<p>In <strong>transanal endoscopic microsurgery</strong> a surgeon inserts a specially designed magnifying scope through the anus and into your rectum, and uses it to remove the tumour from the wall of your rectum. This can also be done with a general or local anaesthetic.</p></div>

<p>If your rectal cancer was found at a very early stage, it is often possible for it to be removed using local removal, through the anus. If local removal is used on a later stage tumour, there is a chance the surgeon will not be able to spot or remove tumours that have spread to the lymph nodes.</p>

<p>Monitoring does not cure your cancer or stop it from spreading, unlike most other treatments for rectal cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A part of monitoring may mean having regular checks to see what is happening to your cancer. Monitoring is an option if you can't have other treatments, or don't want to have other treatments for rectal cancer.</p>
<p>Not everyone who has rectal cancer wants to have treatment to stop the cancer growing or spreading. Some people decide not to have treatments for their cancer, if they feel this will have little effect on how long they live. These people may feel that they don't want to spend time in their later years having surgery or other treatments.</p>
<p>Doctors recommend that if you decide not to have treatment, you still have regular appointments to see if your condition has changed or the cancer is growing.</p>
<p>Monitoring also involves treating your symptoms,&nbsp;like laser therapy to stop any bleeding inside your bowel, or blood transfusions if you have lost a lot of blood. Monitoring also involves&nbsp;treatments to help you manage your pain (palliative treatments).</p>
<p>You can discuss with your doctor exactly what kinds of treatments might be available to help you. You can also see a specialist nurse who can advise you on what types of foods to eat and ways to stay as healthy as you can for as long as possible.</p></div>
