<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

                <div data-cms-content-id="121_1_further-info_744"><p>A joint is where two bones meet. Joints hold your bones together and allow your bones to move. There are many different types of joints in your body.</p>
<p>On the outside of a joint are ligaments. These are strong fibres that keep your bones in place. The ligaments form an envelope that surrounds the joint. This envelope is called a joint capsule.</p>
<p>Inside the joint capsule is the lining of the joint. This is known as the synovial membrane. This lining makes a fluid called synovial fluid that keeps the joint moving smoothly, much like oil in a car engine.</p>
<p>The ends of the bones that meet in a joint are covered with a hard, slippery material called cartilage. The cartilage makes the ends of the bones smooth so that bones can move easily. Cartilage also protects the ends of the bones from rubbing against each other.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="121_1_further-info_745"><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. It makes your joints painful, tender, stiff, and swollen. An autoimmune disease is when your own immune system attacks your body. Your immune system normally protects you against infections and diseases. When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks the joints in your body. We don&rsquo;t know for certain why people get rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis can affect different joints in different people. It usually affects similar joints on both sides of your body. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. It can also affect other parts of your body, such as your heart and kidneys.</p>
<p>People with rheumatoid arthritis usually have it for the rest of their life. Over time it can make your joints lose their shape and stop them from working properly. Treatment can help slow or stop the progress of the disease for some people. This doesn't mean you stop having rheumatoid arthritis, but treatment may mean you have periods when you don't have symptoms and the joints don't get worse.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="121_1_further-info_746"><p>The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;include painful, tender, stiff, and swollen joints. Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis are especially stiff in the morning and they may feel hot when you touch them. Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis may not work as well as they should and this can make everyday tasks, like getting dressed, difficult.</p>
<p>When you get swelling in your joints, this is called synovitis. People with severe synovitis may feel unwell and tired, and have a high temperature. They may lose weight and feel depressed.</p>
<p>Some people with rheumatoid arthritis have symptoms that come and go (flare-ups of symptoms). Other people have symptoms that get worse over time.</p>
<p>People with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to have vascular diseases (problems with blood vessels and circulation) and heart problems than people who don't have rheumatoid arthritis. This may be because the inflammation that affects your joints might also affect other parts of the body, including your heart.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions.

<li><strong>Drinking alcohol heavily</strong>: If you drink large amounts of alcohol regularly, you may be more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis than if you don't drink. There is some evidence that drinking a small amount of alcohol (a few drinks per week) might lower your chance of getting rheumatoid arthritis more than if you don't drink alcohol.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-6">6</span>]<span id="reference-6" class="content-reference">Di Giuseppe D, Alfredsson L, Bottai M, et al.

It can be difficult to diagnose because:[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions.

<li>Many people see their doctor for aches, pains, and swelling in their bones and muscles, but most don't have rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>There isn't a test that can tell for certain if someone has rheumatoid arthritis (although a number of results from different tests can help your doctor make a diagnosis).</li>
</ul>
<p>Before making a diagnosis, your doctor or specialist will check your joints for swelling and to see how well they move. You might have a blood test to check for a chemical called 'rheumatoid factor'. People with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to have this chemical in their blood, although not having it doesn't mean you won't have rheumatoid arthritis. You might need to have an x-ray.</p>
<p>Your doctor or specialist is likely to talk to you about measuring the severity of your symptoms using the Disease Activity Score (or DAS for short). It's sometimes called DAS28 because 28 of your joints may be affected by rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>When working out your DAS28, your doctor or specialist will look at how many tender and swollen joints you have, at your blood test results, and at your 'global assessment of health' score. The global assessment of health is a tool used by your doctor or specialist to score how well you feel on a one to 10 scale. Your doctor or specialist will use all of these measurements to work out your overall DAS28.</p>
<ul>
<li>A DAS28 of more than 5.1 means your disease is not well controlled. This is called having active disease.</li>
<li>A DAS28 between 3.2 and 5.1 means the disease is moderately active.</li>
<li>A DAS28 of less than 3.2 means your disease is well controlled.</li>
<li>A DAS28 of less than 2.6 means your disease is not getting any worse, or you're improving. This is called being in remission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DAS28 is one useful way of checking how well you are doing, but it can't calculate how well you yourself feel. You can always talk to your doctor about how well you feel and about your treatment.</p>
<p>Your specialist will check your DAS28 regularly. The advantage of this is that, if your disease score increases, your specialist can suggest doing something to try to lower it. This may mean suggesting different medications or combinations of medications.</p></div>

<p>Rheumatoid arthritis specialists are experts in tailoring treatment to fit individuals, and in reacting to changes in your condition so that they can give you the best possible treatment. This is why it's important to talk to your specialist and tell them about your symptoms and how you feel. They can't tell everything from tests, and your input is crucial.</p>
<p>Keeping a close eye on your disease activity in this way can help reduce long-term damage to your joints.</p>
<p>Many people with rheumatoid arthritis cope better when they learn more about their disease and how to manage it themselves.

<p>Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis almost always includes some medications (drugs). Some people with rheumatoid arthritis find that none of the available drug treatments help them enough. These are usually people with severely damaged joints. Some of these people choose to have surgery. Surgery for rheumatoid arthritis may be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove inflamed joint tissue</li>
<li>Correct joint problems</li>
<li>Replace damaged joints completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people with rheumatoid arthritis find drug treatments helpful and do not need surgery. The results of surgery may depend on whether you can also get good control over the disease using drugs. Surgery does not slow down the progress of rheumatoid arthritis.</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="121_2_further-info_758_0"><p>Single drug treatment for rheumatoid arthritis means taking a medication to help treat your symptoms and to help slow any damage to your joints. Early treatment can stop some, but not all, joint damage.</p>
<p>The main drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis are called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (or DMARDs for short). These drugs can help reduce the pain and swelling in your joints, and help make your joints less stiff. They can also help reduce the damage to your joints.</p>
<p>The drugs you are likely to be offered first (these are called first-line treatments) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>methotrexate</li>
<li>sulfasalazine</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people in the UK are offered methotrexate as the first-line treatment. Doctors here consider it the most effective and safe medicine for most people with rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>There are other DMARDs, including leflunomide and hydroxychloroquine. These are not usually offered as first-line treatments. They are usually used as part of a combination of drugs, when someone is taking more than one DMARD to treat their disease.</p>
<p>If the first-line treatments for rheumatoid arthritis don't work for you, there are other drugs, called second-line treatments, that you may be able to have. You can discuss these with your doctor.</p>
<p>You may have heard of methotrexate being used to treat some cancers. This can worry some people, because they link the drug in their mind with cancer. But methotrexate is just one of many medicines that can treat more than one condition (for example, aspirin can help with heart problems as well as being a painkiller).</p>
<p>It's likely that your doctor will advise you to start taking one or more DMARDs as soon as you're diagnosed. Some doctors prefer to start patients on more than one drug (especially if symptoms are severe), but many doctors prefer starting with one first, and keeping a close eye on how well you do.</p>
<p>Which DMARD your doctor recommends might depend on how severe your symptoms are. You should be offered medication that matches how mild or severe your symptoms are. Your specialist will be able to tell from tests when you might benefit from changing your treatment. This might mean taking a different drug to get better results.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis specialists are experts in reacting to changes in your condition so that they can give you the best possible treatment. This is why it's important to talk to your specialist and tell them about your symptoms and how you feel. They can't tell everything from tests, and your input is crucial.</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="121_2_further-info_759_0"><p>Multiple drug treatment for rheumatoid arthritis means taking two or more different medications to treat your symptoms and to try to slow or stop any joint damage.</p>
<p>The main drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (or DMARDs for short).</p>
<p>These drugs can help reduce the pain and swelling in your joints, and help make your joints less stiff. They can also reduce joint damage. Your doctor might advise you to start taking a combination of DMARDs as soon as you're diagnosed. You will be able to discuss with your doctor the combination of drugs that will help you get the best out of your treatment.</p>
<p>Different types of DMARDs that your doctor may suggest you take in combination for your rheumatoid arthritis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>methotrexate</li>
<li>sulfasalazine</li>
<li>leflunomide</li>
<li>hydroxychloroquine.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctors in the UK consider methotrexate to be the most effective and safe drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis. For most people taking DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple drug treatment will include methotrexate.</p>
<p>You may have heard of methotrexate being used to treat some cancers. This can worry some people, because they link the drug in their mind with cancer. But methotrexate is just one of many medicines that can treat more than one condition (for example, aspirin can help with heart problems as well as being a painkiller).</p>
<p>If your symptoms are mild, your doctor may advise you to start by taking one DMARD. If this doesn't control your symptoms enough, you may need to take more than one DMARD, or other types of drugs as well as a DMARD.</p>
<p>Which DMARDs your doctor recommends might depend on how severe your symptoms are. You should be offered medication that matches how mild or severe your symptoms are. And your specialist will be able to tell from tests when you might benefit from changing your treatment. This might mean taking different drugs or combinations of drugs to get better results.</p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis specialists are experts in reacting to changes in your condition so that they can give you the best possible treatment. This is why it's important to talk to your specialist and tell them about your symptoms and how you feel. They can't tell everything from tests, and your input is crucial.</p>
<p>As well as DMARDs, your doctor might suggest that you take a low dose of a type of drug called a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce the inflammation (pain, swelling, redness, and heat) in your joints. They may also help reduce joint damage if you take them with a DMARD.</p>
<p>People with rheumatoid arthritis might be able to use corticosteroids in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a short period to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, either as tablets, or as injections into the joints.</li>
<li>In a low dose, as part of multiple drug treatment, to help treat the disease itself. Some people may be able to take corticosteroids for longer if they take them in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>People usually take corticosteroids over a short period of time when they're first diagnosed and when they're just starting to take DMARDs. This is because it can take weeks or months before you will be able to notice the effects of DMARDs on your symptoms. Corticosteroids work quickly so they&nbsp;can help your symptoms while the DMARDs start to work.</p>
<p>Many people use corticosteroids when they have a 'flare-up' of their symptoms, because they work quickly to reduce symptoms and get them through the flare-up.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids are not usually suitable as a regular long-term treatment, because they can cause serious side effects if taken for a long time or in high doses. Your doctor will want to make sure you don't use corticosteroids too often. If you find you need to use corticosteroids often, it could be a sign that you need to change your treatment.</p>
<p>The group of drugs listed here are called 'first-line' treatments. This means they are the first drugs your doctor will suggest you take for your rheumatoid arthritis when you're diagnosed. These first-line treatments help most people with rheumatoid arthritis. If they don't work for you, there is another group of drugs called 'second-line' treatments that may help. You can discuss these second-line treatments with your doctor if you need to.</p>
<p>Your doctor may suggest that you take a combination of these first-line drugs to treat your rheumatoid arthritis if one drug is not helping your symptoms as well as you would like.</p></div>

<li>There are some important things you can do to help yourself that medicines can't do.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specialists who care for you will guide you through a self-management programme that best suits you and your symptoms. You may be able to get help from an occupational therapist (OT for short). They can help you with some of the things listed below, such as learning to pace yourself and looking after your joints.</p>
<p>They should also be able to arrange a workplace assessment for you, so that your working environment is as comfortable for you as it can be.</p>
<p>Things people with rheumatoid arthritis can do to help themselves may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking more exercise</li>
<li>Having physiotherapy</li>
<li>Giving up smoking</li>
<li>Eating a healthier diet</li>
<li>Looking after their joints</li>
<li>Pacing their activities</li>
<li>Getting specialist foot care</li>
<li>Making sure they take their medicines when they should. Not taking drugs properly can cause a 'flare-up' of symptoms</li>
<li>Making sure they turn up for appointments. Regular check-ups and blood tests are very important in making sure you get the best treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise and physiotherapy</strong></p>
<p>Exercise is something that you can do yourself to get fitter and stronger. You can do different types of exercises to improve your overall fitness. Strength exercises like lifting small weights will help improve the strength of your muscles. Exercises that make your heart beat faster will help improve your fitness and make your lungs and heart stronger. Movement exercises, like swimming, will help improve the movement in your joints.</p>
<p>Doing an exercise programme with a physiotherapist is another way of doing exercise. This may also&nbsp;include learning to look after your joints and about rheumatoid arthritis and how to deal with flare-ups and pain.</p>
<p><strong>Giving up smoking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People who don't smoke are less likely to&nbsp;get rheumatoid arthritis.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-56">56</span>]<span id="reference-56" class="content-reference">K&auml;llberg H, Ding B, Padyukov L, et al. Smoking is a major preventable risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis: estimations of risks after various exposures to cigarette smoke. Annals of Rheumatic Diseases. 2011; 70: 508-511.</span></li>
<li>People with rheumatoid arthritis who give up smoking may have less severe symptoms than people who continue to smoke.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-57">57</span>]<span id="reference-57" class="content-reference">Saaga KG, Cerhanc JR, Kolluric S, et al. Cigarette smoking and rheumatoid arthritis severity. Annals of Rheumatic Diseases. 1997; 56: 463-469.</span></li>
<li>People with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher chance of getting heart problems.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis: national clinical guideline for management and treatment in adults. Royal College of Physicians, London, UK; 2009.</span>&nbsp;If you're a smoker,&nbsp;giving up&nbsp;smoking may help reduce your chance of getting heart problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eating a healthier diet</strong></p>
<p>Changing to a healthier diet may help your rheumatoid arthritis because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing excess weight, if you are overweight, puts less strain on&nbsp;your joints.</li>
<li>Being too thin and light may mean that your joints, bones, and muscles get weaker. A healthy diet can help you keep to a healthy weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some foods make the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis worse. A dietician can give you advice about this, but not everyone with rheumatoid arthritis reacts the same way to the same foods. Finding out what foods cause problems for you as an individual may take some trial and error.</p>
<p>Also, people with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher chance of getting vascular diseases (problems with blood vessels and circulation) and heart problems. A healthy diet can help keep your heart and blood vessels healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Looking after your joints</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways that you can look after your joints, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding activities that cause pain in your joints, or doing them in a different way. For example, you may feel less pain in your joints doing a particular task sitting down instead of standing.</li>
<li>Using devices to help take the strain from your joints, such as using a jar opener when opening a jar.</li>
<li>Having a&nbsp;good posture when standing or sitting down.</li>
<li>Using the largest and strongest joints and muscles in your body for doing tasks such as lifting.</li>
<li>Splinting. Occasionally some people need to wear splints on painful joints for a while, to help take the pressure off them. An occupational therapist can help with this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pacing your activities</strong></p>
<p>Pacing your activities means learning how much of an activity you can do before it causes you pain. It may be a process of trial and error. Paying attention to what your body is telling you may help reduce the pain that you get from doing certain activities.</p>
<p><strong>Looking after your feet<br /></strong></p>
<p>About <a href="../../../media_manager/public/150/images/Rheumatoid-Arthritis/75-100.jpg" class="image-reference">75 in 100</a> people with rheumatoid arthritis have foot pain or some difficulty walking.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis: national clinical guideline for management and treatment in adults. Royal College of Physicians, London, UK; 2009.</span></p>
<p>Many of these people use specialist foot-care products such as special insoles to help ease the pain in their feet and to help them with walking.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis: national clinical guideline for management and treatment in adults. Royal College of Physicians, London, UK; 2009.</span> Comfortable shoes, often fitted with insoles, can be helpful. Some people find they need slightly bigger shoes that can fit the insoles. <span class="content-reference"><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Taking extra medicines</strong></p>
<p>As well as the DMARDs your doctor may prescribe, there are other medicines that can help when your symptoms are particularly bad. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>corticosteroids</li>
<li>NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)</li>
<li>analgesics (painkillers).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce the inflammation (pain, swelling, redness, and heat) in your joints. They may also help reduce damage to your joints caused by your rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>People with rheumatoid arthritis might be able to use corticosteroids in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a short period to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, either as tablets, or as injections into the joints.</li>
<li>In a low dose, as part of multiple drug treatment, to help treat the disease itself. Some people may be able to take corticosteroids for a longer spell if they take them in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people with rheumatoid arthritis who take corticosteroids use them over a short period when they are first diagnosed and just starting to take DMARDs. This is because it can take weeks or months before you will be able to notice the effects of DMARDs on your symptoms. Corticosteroids work quickly so they may help your symptoms while the DMARDs start to work.</p>
<p>Many people use corticosteroids when they have a 'flare-up' of their symptoms, because they work quite quickly. If you find that your symptoms flare up, causing you a lot of pain, you can talk to your doctor about corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can be given as tablets or as injections directly into the joints.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids are not usually suitable as a regular, long-term treatment, because they can cause serious side effects if taken for a long time. Your doctor will want to make sure you don't use corticosteroids too often. If you find you need to use corticosteroids often, it could be a sign that you need to change your treatment.</p>
<p><strong>NSAIDs</strong> are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help reduce the inflammation in your joints. NSAIDs won't reduce the damage to your joints. Some commonly used NSAIDs are ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. NSAIDs are also used as painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>Analgesics</strong> are usually called painkillers. Some commonly used analgesics are paracetamol and codeine. These drugs can help reduce the pain you get from rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
