<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>

<p>Some particles in smoke seem to make 'bad' cholesterol in your blood stick to your blood vessels. This cholesterol build-up makes your blood vessels narrower and increases your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>If you smoke when you're pregnant, smoke can damage your baby's health. The chemicals in smoke keep the baby from getting all the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. If you smoke when pregnant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your baby is likely to weigh less than if you hadn't smoked - infants who don't weigh enough are likely to have breathing problems</li>
<li>Your baby may be born early and need special care</li>
<li>Your child is more likely to get asthma</li>
<li>Up to 1 in 10 infant deaths may be related to the mother smoking while she was pregnant.</li>

<p>If you don't feel ready to give up smoking completely, or if you feel it would be too hard to give up straight away, you could try reducing (cutting down) the amount you smoke.

<p>Nicotine is a chemical found in all tobacco products, whether it's cigarettes, cigars or a pipe, or chewing tobacco. It's the nicotine that gives you a 'hit'.&nbsp;</p>

<li>If you're addicted, from time to time your body craves nicotine and you feel you need to have a cigarette.</li>

<p>Some of the difficulty in giving up smoking is about breaking a habit, rather than actually being addicted to nicotine.&nbsp;Seeing other people smoking, especially if you live with someone who smokes, can make you want a cigarette. Many people link smoking to particular activities, such as having a coffee break or going for a drink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy and drugs can help you overcome nicotine cravings. Counselling or self-help strategies may help you make changes and break your smoking habits.

<p>Self-managed quitting or reduction means trying to stop smoking or to reduce (cut down) how much you smoke on your own, without help from a doctor or other health professional. This could mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using nicotine replacement therapy products that you can buy over the counter from a pharmacy</li>
<li>Using self-help materials, such as books or websites, which can give you information and help about reducing or quitting</li>
<li>Rewarding yourself for smoking less or for stopping altogether</li>
<li>Socialising with other people who are trying to stop smoking</li>
<li>Using electronic cigarettes (so-called e-cigarettes) instead of smoking</li>
<li>Just using your willpower to cut down or stop smoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to try just one of these methods. You could try any combination of them that suits you. Below is some information on the various options in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</strong> means getting nicotine from something other than tobacco. This means that you can continue to take in nicotine for a while, without all the health problems you get from smoking tobacco.</p>
<p>Most people use nicotine replacement therapy for about three months after they stop smoking, but it can be used for longer.</p>
<p>You can get various kinds of nicotine replacement therapy products, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patches that you put on your skin, which look a bit like sticking plasters</li>
<li>Chewing gum</li>
<li>Inhalers - some look a bit like the inhalers some people use for asthma; others look a bit like cigarettes, but they are not the same as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)</li>
<li>Tablets that you put under your tongue</li>
<li>Lozenges that melt slowly in the mouth</li>
<li>Mouth or nasal (nose) sprays.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy them from chemists or supermarkets. You can use just one type of product, or any combination of products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best not to smoke when using nicotine replacement therapy, but some people use it while they cut down gradually before stopping.</p>
<p>You could choose to try nicotine replacement therapy on its own, or you could try it at the same time as some other treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Self-help guides</strong></p>
<p>These are things you can use to help you stop smoking without medicines or other treatments. They may contain information about the harm smoking can do, and encouragement to help you stop. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books</li>
<li>CDs</li>
<li>DVDs</li>
<li>Websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Willpower</strong></p>
<p>Using your willpower to stop smoking means stopping without using any treatments, just your determination to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)</strong></p>
<p>Electronic cigarettes are a fairly new kind of treatment. They are plastic tubes that look a bit like real cigarettes. You puff on them in the same way you would a real cigarette, but they don't burn like tobacco does. They contain nicotine that you breathe in every time you puff on them.</p>
<p>Although e-cigarettes contain nicotine, they can't really be classed as nicotine replacement therapy as they haven't been tested as thoroughly as other products. It's not certain how much nicotine they actually contain. It may not be enough to replace the nicotine you would get from a cigarette.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-25">25</span>]<span id="reference-25" class="content-reference">U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>Some people reward themselves for not smoking - after all, stopping can be hard, and you may feel you deserve a treat for managing to stop or cut down. This might mean buying yourself a present, or spending time doing something you enjoy, when you achieve no-smoking 'milestones'.</p>
<p>For example, you might give yourself a reward for quitting for the first week, then for getting through the first month, then for every month or few months after that. If you think about how expensive it is to smoke, you could pay for your rewards using some or all of the money you save when you stop.</p>
<p>Some people can get involved in no-smoking reward schemes where they work.

<p><strong>Socialising with other people who are quitting</strong></p>
<p>Some people find it harder to stop smoking if they socialise with other people who smoke. If you usually socialise with other people who smoke, you might be able to find a stop-smoking group in your area, perhaps through the internet. Meeting socially with other people who are trying to quit may help motivate you.</p>
<p>Or it could just mean arranging to meet friends who don't smoke, at least until you feel you can be around others who smoke without feeling tempted to join in.</p></div>

This could be a nurse, counsellor, or someone who is trained to help people stop smoking.</p>
<p>The kind of help you can get from health professionals includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines to help you stop smoking</li>
<li>Nicotine replacement therapy products (such as gum and patches), with support and advice to help you cut down or stop</li>
<li>Counselling to help you stop smoking</li>
<li>Different combinations of these treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two <strong>medicines</strong> that&nbsp;you can get with a prescription from your doctor, which may help you stop smoking. They are&nbsp;called <strong>bupropion</strong> and <strong>varenicline</strong>.</p>
<p>If you take varenicline tablets you usually start taking one a day, then increase to taken two a day. One week after you have started taking <strong>varenicline</strong>, you set a date to stop smoking. You continue taking the tablets for 12 weeks, while you try to stop smoking. If you stop smoking, you can continue taking it for an additional 12 weeks.</p>
<p>You may need to start taking varenicline at a low dose, then build up to a higher dose, so your body has time to adjust to the drug.</p>
<p>If you take buproprion tablets you usually start taking one a day, then increase to two a day. You usually continue taking the tablets for between seven and nine weeks.</p>
<p>Doctors usually only prescribe bupropion or varenicline as part of a programme to stop smoking. This means that if you want to take these drugs you will need to agree to have counselling. You will need to have at least one appointment with a nurse or doctor to discuss smoking and how to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</strong> means getting nicotine from something other than tobacco. This means that you can continue to take in nicotine for a while, without all the health problems you get from smoking tobacco.</p>
<p>You can buy nicotine replacement therapy products over the counter from a pharmacy. Or you could get them on prescription through your doctor. If you choose to get them through your doctor, or to talk to your doctor about using nicotine replacement therapy, they can give you advice on how best to use them.</p>
<p>You may be able to get support when using these products from a health professional who is not a doctor. This could be a nurse or someone who is trained to help people stop smoking. You may find that talking to a health professional about your progress from time to time helps you not to smoke.</p>
<p>Most people use nicotine replacement therapy for about three months after they stop smoking, but it can be used for longer.</p>
<p>You can get various kinds of nicotine replacement therapy products, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patches that you put on your skin, which look a bit like sticking plasters</li>
<li>Chewing gum</li>
<li>Inhalers - some look a bit like the inhalers some people use for asthma; others look a bit like cigarettes, but they are not the same as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)</li>
<li>Tablets that you put under your tongue</li>
<li>Lozenges that melt slowly in the mouth</li>
<li>Mouth or nasal (nose) sprays.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use just one type of product, or any combination of products.</p>
<p>It's best not to smoke when using nicotine replacement therapy, but some people use it while they cut down gradually before stopping.</p>
<p>You could choose to try nicotine replacement therapy on its own, or you could try it at the same time as some other treatments, such as counselling or some alternative treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Counselling</strong> is a 'talking treatment'. When you have counselling you talk with someone who is trained to help you with a particular problem.</p>
<p>If you have counselling to help you stop smoking, you can do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>In person, one to one with your counsellor</li>
<li>Over the phone, one to one with your counsellor</li>
<li>With a group of people who want to stop smoking and a counsellor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your counsellor may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A nurse</li>
<li>A doctor</li>
<li>Someone who is not a nurse or a doctor, but who is trained to help people stop smoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to try counselling by itself to stop smoking, or you could use it at the same time as trying other treatments, such as prescription drugs, nicotine replacement therapy, or some alternative treatments.</p>
<p>If you want to take prescription drugs to help you stop smoking, you will usually have to have counselling as well.</p></div>

<p>Bupropion is used to help people stop smoking, but it can also be used to treat depression. For people who smoke, it can help by easing the mental withdrawal symptoms you may feel when you stop smoking.</p>
<p>Varenicline helps ease withdrawal symptoms. It does this by mimicking the effects of nicotine, so that you don't feel the need for nicotine.</p>
<p>Varenicline also reduces the pleasant effects you get from nicotine, so that if you have a cigarette while you're taking varenicline, you won't enjoy it as much as you usually do. Some people find this makes it easier for them to stop smoking.</p>

They may not have been studied as thoroughly as other options we look at here. This means there is less evidence about how well they work.</p>
<p>These options include:</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>This is a traditional Chinese treatment. If you have acupuncture, a trained acupuncturist puts sterile needles into your skin.</p>
<p>Some people have acupuncture to try to help reduce the withdrawal symptoms they get when they stop smoking. Usually, treatment starts some days before the person actually stops smoking. The acupuncturist inserts needles in the outer ear (or in other parts of the body) for 15 to 20 minutes. The treatment may be repeated over the following days.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-70">70</span>]<span id="reference-70" class="content-reference">White AR, Rampes H, Liu JP, et al. Acupuncture and related interventions for smoking cessation (Cochrane review). In: The Cochrane Library. Wiley, Chichester, UK.</span></p>
<p><strong>Hypnosis</strong></p>
<p>Some people go to a hypnotherapist when trying to stop smoking. This kind of therapist uses hypnosis to make you feel very deeply relaxed. This kind of relaxation is sometimes called a hypnotic trance. The hypnotherapist then gives you suggestions to help you change the way you behave.</p>
<p>If you're trying to stop smoking, your hypnotherapist may suggest that you don't need cigarettes or that you don't like smoking anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Homeopathy</strong></p>
<p>The idea of homeopathy is that a small amount of what makes someone ill can also help cure them. So homeopathic medicines are highly diluted. Practitioners believe these diluted substances can help the body heal itself. There are many homeopathic products that are aimed at helping people stop smoking, including Nux vomica and Lobelia.</p>
<p><strong>Herbal remedies</strong></p>
<p>Several herbal remedies are aimed at helping people stop smoking, including Lobelia, St. John's Wort, and Ginseng. The idea of herbal remedies is that they either reduce withdrawal symptoms, or interfere with chemicals in the brain that give people pleasure from smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Reflexology</strong></p>
<p>Reflexology is a type of massage, involving the hands, feet, and ears. Reflexologists believe that the different areas of the body are somehow mirrored on different parts of the hands and feet. They believe that putting pressure on the parts of your hands or feet that are somehow connected to your lungs can help you stop smoking.</p>
<p>You can try any of these treatments on their own, or you might want to think about using some of them alongside drugs, nicotine replacement therapy, or counselling.</p></div>
