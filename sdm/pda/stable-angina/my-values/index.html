<p>The Decision Support team is made of professional Health Coaches who are&nbsp;clinicians, commonly nurses, who have undertaken additional training to become a Health Coach.</p>
<p>The Health Coaches will assist you by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with information</li>
<li>Helping you to understand your condition</li>
<li>Recognise what is important to you regarding the outcome of treatment</li>
<li>Identifying potential solutions</li>
<li>Encourage you in discussing options with your family</li>
<li>Transferring skills which will assist you in using the information and resources available to you</li>
<li>Support you in building confidence in discussing your choice with your doctor</li>
<li>You may find that this can be achieved in one telephone call with a Health Coach however; if further calls are required to support you in reaching your decision the Health Coach will schedule these with you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Important Things To Note</p>
<ul>
<li>A Health Coach does not know which treatment option is best for you.</li>
<li>The Health Coach does not have information about your medical history.</li>
<li>You will still need to talk over your decision and reasons for your decision with your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>
<p class="further-info-sub-heading">Hours Of Operation</p>
<p>Our Decision Support service runs from 9am - 5:30pm Monday to Friday</p></div><!--

<p>The two chambers on the right side of your heart pump blood to your lungs, where the blood picks up oxygen. Blood and oxygen from your lungs return to the two chambers on the left side of your heart, which then pump it to the rest of your body.</p>
<p>Your heart also needs its own supply of blood so that it can work. Your heart gets this blood from the coronary arteries. You have a left coronary artery and a right coronary artery. They supply the heart's muscular wall with blood that has a lot of oxygen in it.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="110_1_further-info_573"><p>Angina is the temporary pain or discomfort you get when your heart doesn&rsquo;t get enough oxygen. It is not a heart attack. The pain does not harm the heart.</p>
<p>Angina is usually caused by coronary artery disease. This is when bits of abnormal tissue (called plaques) develop on the inside of your coronary arteries. Over time your coronary arteries get narrower, stiffer, and rougher. This means&nbsp;less blood and oxygen can get to your heart, especially when you exercise. This lack of blood and oxygen to the heart causes the symptoms of angina.</p>
<p>Any of your coronary arteries can be affected in angina, and more than one artery may be affected.</p>
<p>Angina can be called &lsquo;stable&rsquo; or &lsquo;unstable&rsquo;. Stable angina is when you have a regular pattern to your angina symptoms. You get symptoms when your heart is working harder than usual, but they go away after you rest for a few minutes or after you take angina drugs. Unstable angina is when you have no regular pattern to your angina symptoms.</p>
<p>When you have had angina for a while, you will be able to learn to recognise the pattern of symptoms and know when it will happen. You have stable angina when you've had a regular pattern of symptoms for at least two months.</p>
<p>Things that can bring on angina are walking up a hill or stairs, eating a heavy meal, or going out in cold weather. It can also happen when you get angry, upset, or excited.</p>
<p>When you are at rest, or feeling calm, your heart doesn't work harder than normal. Your heart will usually have enough oxygen for its needs, and you shouldn&rsquo;t feel any pain or discomfort.</p></div>

You might feel stabbing pains, tightness and pressure in your chest, as well as general discomfort or tingling. Some people feel these symptoms in their back, shoulder, throat, arm, or jaw.</p>
<p>Pain or discomfort from stable angina should go when you stop doing what it is that is causing your heart to work harder. If exercise brings on your angina symptoms, they should go away soon after you stop exercising. You can exercise providing you don't get symptoms. If you get angina symptoms, you should stop exercising.</p>
<p>If your symptoms don't go away within 15 minutes you should call an ambulance straight away.</p>
<p>If you take drugs called short-acting nitrates to help with angina attacks, you should call an ambulance straight away if your symptoms don't go away after taking two doses of the drugs.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>Being a man</li>
<li>Being middle-aged or older</li>
<li>Having close family members who had heart attacks at an early age (before about 55)</li>
<li>Smoking tobacco</li>
<li>Having high cholesterol,&nbsp;high&nbsp;blood pressure, chronic kidney disease or&nbsp;diabetes</li>
<li>Being overweight or obese, or not doing enough exercise.</li>

Your doctor will ask you what the pain or discomfort feels like, what brings it on, how long it lasts, and what makes it go away. Your doctor might also ask about risk factors, such as whether you smoke, your diet, and if there is anyone in your family with heart problems.</p>
<p>Your doctor may check your weight, breathing, pulse, and blood pressure. They may also check your skin for bumps, which can be a sign of high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Your doctor may suggest other tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can tell if your heart is working properly. They may also do blood tests to check for anaemia, diabetes, overactive thyroid, and high cholesterol. Anaemia and overactive thyroid can give you symptoms that are like angina symptoms. Your doctor may also suggest a chest x-ray or stress test. A stress test can check how much exercise your heart can cope with.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already been told by your doctor that you have stable angina you may have had some of these tests already.</p></div>

Having angina does not mean people should stop exercising or living a normal life. There are things people can do to make their heart healthier, such as not smoking, eating more fruit and vegetables, and avoiding foods that are high in fat and sugar.</p>
<p>If you have angina you probably have coronary artery disease. This means you have a higher chance of having a heart attack than someone without coronary artery disease.&nbsp;It might help to think of angina as a warning that you might have a heart attack in the future.</p>
<p>People with stable angina who have treatment can live for many years. Your doctor won&rsquo;t be able to tell you how long you will live if you have stable angina.</p>
<p>People with angina may be offered two types of drug to help them. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-anginal drugs to help prevent angina symptoms. These drugs may also help treat the symptoms when they occur.</li>
<li>Drugs to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, or other heart problems. These are called secondary prevention drugs, and include medicines such as aspirin and statins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may also talk to you about changes you can make to your lifestyle to help prevent heart problems, or&nbsp;having revascularisation to control your symptoms.</p>
<p>If you have other health problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you should ask your doctor about separate treatment for these.</p></div>

<p><strong>Learning about angina and living healthily</strong></p>
<p>People with angina feel better and stay healthier when they learn more about their condition. [<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Stable angina. July 2011. Available at http://www.nice.org.uk/CG126 (accessed on 10 September 2012).</span> Many people believe things about angina that are not true. For example, some people think that angina is having a &lsquo;mini&rsquo; heart attack, or they think having angina means they should stop exercising. These things are not true. Many people live for many years with stable angina.</p>
<p>There are various ways people can learn more about their condition, including reading and listening to recorded information about angina, and speaking with their doctor or nurse. There are also educational programmes that can help people manage their angina while they learn about their condition at the same time.</p>
<p>One of these educational programmes is called the Angina Management Programme. This programme involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education about angina, what it is and what it isn&rsquo;t</li>
<li>Managing stress</li>
<li>Setting goals for the future</li>
<li>Relaxation and breathing techniques</li>
<li>Finding the amount of exercise that&rsquo;s right for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Angina Plan is another programme that is similar to the Angina Management Programme. It uses a workbook to help you learn about your condition.</p>
<p><strong>Stopping smoking <br /></strong></p>
<p>Smoking can cause heart disease. Stopping smoking can help improve your cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels) system and help you live longer.</p>
<p><strong>Exercising more</strong></p>
<p>People with angina should not stop exercising. You can exercise providing you don't get symptoms. Exercise is an important part of looking after your heart. Your doctor can help you decide on a reasonable and safe amount of exercise for you to take. They can also advise you on the best type of exercise to take. If you get angina symptoms, you should stop exercising.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking about what you eat<br /></strong></p>
<p>Your diet can affect the health of your heart and coronary arteries. Cutting down on certain fats and on sugary foods, and eating more fish, fruit, and vegetables will help keep your heart and arteries in better shape. Eating a healthier diet may also help you lose weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>There are two groups of drugs for stable angina. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-anginal drugs</strong>, which help prevent angina symptoms and also treat the symptoms when they occur</li>
<li><strong>Secondary prevention drugs</strong>, which&nbsp;reduce your chances of having a heart attack, a stroke or other cardiovascular diseases. They do not prevent or treat your angina symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of <strong>anti-anginal drugs</strong> people are usually offered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorter-acting nitrates</li>
<li>Beta-blockers</li>
<li>Calcium-channel blockers</li>
<li>Longer-acting nitrates</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers. If one doesn&rsquo;t work for you or gives you side effects, you and your doctor can look at trying another type.</p>
<p>Your doctor will usually suggest you try beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers first. If these do not work for you, your doctor may suggest you try longer-acting nitrates.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of nitrates: longer-acting nitrates and shorter-acting nitrates. Shorter-acting nitrates are used to treat symptoms when they happen. Shorter-acting nitrates start working quickly when you have symptoms, but their effects don't last long. These can be tablets that melt in your mouth or a spray that you put under your tongue. Longer-acting nitrate drugs have effects that last longer. They come as tablets. They are usually used to prevent angina symptoms.</p>
<p>You may be offered a combination of these anti-anginal drugs. If these drugs do not work for you, or if there is any reason you can&rsquo;t take them, you may be offered other drugs. These will probably be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicorandil</li>
<li>Ranolazine</li>
<li>Ivabradine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main <strong>secondary prevention drugs</strong> for angina are statins and aspirin, or other drugs that work like aspirin, called anti-platelet drugs.</p>
<p>Statins help prevent heart attacks and strokes by lowering levels of harmful cholesterol in your blood. Aspirin and other anti-platelet drugs help prevent heart attacks and strokes by stopping your blood from clotting too easily.&nbsp; This is something that you should discuss with your doctor. Your doctor may suggest you start taking statins, and possibly aspirin, right away.&nbsp;</p></div>

                        <div data-cms-content-id="110_2_further-info_582_0"><p>Revascularisation is a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart. The two main types of revascularisation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)</li>
<li>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). CABG is a major operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of PCI and CABG. Your doctor will be able to tell you more about which type of procedure is best for you.&nbsp;The main purpose of both procedures is to treat angina symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who have either PCI or CABG still need to carry on taking some drugs, probably for life.</p>
<p>PCI is a procedure that widens the arteries to make it easier for blood to flow to the heart. This should improve angina symptoms. It is usually carried out by a heart doctor (cardiologist).</p>
<p>During the procedure, a doctor uses a tiny deflated balloon attached to the end of a thin tube. This tube is inserted into your body, usually near your groin. It is then fed through your blood vessels until it reaches the part of your artery that is blocked. The doctor then inflates and deflates the balloon several times, widening the artery and getting blood flowing through it again.</p>
<p>Most people who have a PCI also have a stent put into the artery. This is a small tube inserted into the artery to keep it open. It acts like a kind of scaffold, to stop the artery closing up again.</p>
<p>CABG (pronounced cabbage) is a major operation carried out by a surgeon. The aim is to improve the blood flow to your heart, which should help your angina symptoms. In a bypass operation, a surgeon takes parts of healthy blood vessels from another part of your body (such as your leg) and uses them to take over from the narrowed arteries in your heart.</p>
<p>Before people are offered PCI or CABG, they have a test called an angiogram. This is a type of x-ray that helps the surgeon see the coronary arteries.</p>
<p>During the test, the surgeon will put a thin tube (called a catheter) into an artery in your arm or thigh, and carefully feed this through to the coronary arteries. The surgeon will then inject a dye through the tube into your coronary arteries. This dye will show up on the x-ray and the surgeon can tell how much your coronary arteries are narrowed. Before the test you may be given drugs to help you relax so that the surgeon can carry out the test without causing you too much discomfort.</p>
<p>Angina is usually caused by coronary artery disease. Doctors and surgeons can use angiograms to classify coronary artery disease based on which blood vessels are narrowed.</p></div>

<p>Some people may only be able to have one type of revascularisation, because of their health or because of the type of heart disease they have.</p>
<p>To have revascularisation you have to be well enough to go through the operation without too high a risk to your health. This especially applies to CABG surgery, which is a major operation.</p>
