The two smaller chambers at the top are called the left atrium and the right atrium. Together they are called the atria. Blood enters the heart by flowing into the atria. The atria then pump the blood into the two bigger, lower chambers.</p>
<p>The two lower chambers are called the left ventricle and the right ventricle. Their job is to pump blood out of the heart and around the body.</p>
<p>The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The top right chamber of the heart (right atrium) contains a natural 'pacemaker' which sets the rate at which the heart beats. The pacemaker sends out an electrical signal to make the muscles in the heart contract in a regular way. The contraction pushes blood through the heart and around the body.</p></div>

                <div data-cms-content-id="262_1_further-info_1203"><p>Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are conditions that affect how your heart beats. Usually, your heart beats regularly. If you have atrial fibrillation, it beats irregularly, and usually faster. If you have atrial flutter, it beats faster, but still regularly.</p>
<p>People with atrial fibrillation can also have atrial flutter at times. The treatments available&nbsp;for atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation&nbsp;are the same, which is why we've included both of them in this decision aid. Anything we say about atrial fibrillation in this decision aid applies to atrial flutter too, unless we say it does not.</p>
<p>Atrial fibrillation happens because the pacemaker that controls the muscles of the heart doesn't work properly. It sends out too many electrical signals at once. This makes the muscles of the heart contract too fast, which means that blood is pumped out in an irregular way.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of irregular heartbeats. Atrial fibrillation is the most common.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-1">1</span>]<span id="reference-1" class="content-reference">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions.

<p>If you've had atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter for some time, you may not realise that your heart is beating irregularly or fast because you have become used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the other symptoms people with atrial fibrillation experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Feeling tired.</li>

You'll probably have this&nbsp;at your local hospital or clinic. Some GPs do the test in their own surgery.</p>
<p>An electrocardiogram is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart, while you wear a monitor attached to your chest.</p>
<p>Because atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter come and go, the ECG might not pick up any problems during your appointment.If that happens you may need to wear an ECG monitor for 24 hours. (Your doctor may call this an ambulatory monitor or a&nbsp;Holter monitor.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your ECG shows atrial fibrillation, you may also have other tests done to find out the cause of your irregular heartbeat. These tests might include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echocardiogram</strong>. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan of your heart. It is a painless test that can help identify possible causes of atrial fibrillation, such as heart disease or problems with the heart's valves.</li>
<li><strong>X-ray</strong>. A chest x-ray can help doctors see if problems with your lungs are causing your irregular heartbeats. Lung cancer and pulmonary embolisms (blood clots on the lung) can cause atrial fibrillation.</li>
<li><strong>Blood test</strong>. A blood test can help identify if you have too much of a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, called thyroxine, which can cause atrial fibrillation.</li>

That happens because the heart isn't beating properly. The upper chambers of the heart (the atria)&nbsp;beat irregularly and are unable to pump all the blood out. If blood stays in one place for too long, it starts to clot. Blood clots increase your chances of having a stroke.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the heart pumps out&nbsp;one&nbsp;or more of these clots (an embolus). If the clot travels through the blood vessels, it can block an artery to the brain and cause a&nbsp;stroke. This type of stroke, where the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen, is called an <strong>ischaemic stroke</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CHADS2 scores range from 0 to 6 points. The score helps&nbsp;predict your&nbsp;chance of having a stroke over the course of a year.

<p>There is a newer&nbsp;system for predicting the chance of having a stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation&nbsp;called CHA2DS2-VASc. In this decision aid, we will be using the more widely used CHADS2 system.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about your individual chance of having a stroke, you can talk to your GP. Your doctor can advise you whether to have treatment based on your individual chance of having a stroke and of the chance of treatment complications. But they can't make you have treatment you don't want: the decision is yours.</p></div>

<p>There are three main types of anticoagulant used to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (the names of the medicines are in brackets):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin)</li>
<li>Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban)</li>
<li>Thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran).</li>
</ul>
<p>All anticoagulant medicines come in the form of tablets.</p>
<p>Warfarin is the main anticoagulant prescribed in the UK. It has been used for many years and a lot is known about it. Apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban are newer medicines.</p>
<p>One big difference between these medicines for patients is that people taking warfarin need to have regular blood tests, usually at a clinic, to make sure the dose is right for them. People taking the newer drugs don't need to have these blood tests. Taking these newer drugs may give people more freedom than taking warfarin.</p>
<p>Blood clots are formed when a protein called fibrinogen is changed into another protein called fibrin. The process that changes fibrinogen to fibrin is called the clotting cascade. All anticoagulants act on some part of the clotting cascade to stop blood clotting too easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Medicines that prevent the blood from clotting can increase the chance of bleeding (haemorrhage). This can happen with all anticoagulants.</p></div>

<p>Most people can take anticoagulants. But people may not be able to take anticoagulants if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant</li>
<li>Have recently had surgery or are due to have surgery</li>
<li>Have liver disease</li>

<p>If you are unsure whether this applies to you, you can speak to your doctor. Your doctor will also want to know if you are taking other medication. Some medicines, such as&nbsp;non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) or drugs for breathing problems called oral corticosteroids (e.g., asthma inhalers) increase the chance of bleeding.</p>
<p>Just as there is a scoring system to assess someone's chance of having a stroke (CHADS2), there is another that assesses people's chance of bleeding if they take anticoagulants. This is called the HAS-BLED tool. It works in much the same way as CHADS2, by using a points score. You and your doctor can use this tool to see if there is a chance that anticoagulants might not be safe for you.</p></div>

<p>Taking anticoagulants can affect what you can do. There are some foods, drinks, and medicines that can interfere with anticoagulants, particularly warfarin. Some people find this affects what they can do.</p>
<p>Foods&nbsp;that contain vitamin K interfere with warfarin (broccoli, brussels sprouts, chard, kale, spinach, etc.) as does grapefruit.&nbsp;Alcohol can also affect how warfarin works.&nbsp;Medicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) and antibiotics, and herbal&nbsp;medicines,&nbsp;can interfere with warfarin.

<p>If you take&nbsp;the newer anticoagulants,&nbsp;you won't&nbsp;need to have&nbsp;your blood tested. Taking these newer drugs may give people more freedom than taking warfarin.</p>
<p>People taking warfarin have their blood tested to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is not too thin, which increases the chance of bleeding, or</li>
<li>too thick, which increases the chance of blood forming clots that may lead to a stroke.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of warfarin on&nbsp;your blood is measured by the international normalised ratio (INR).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;take warfarin, you&nbsp;have your blood tested once or twice a week until&nbsp;your dose has been adjusted to the right INR level. After&nbsp;your blood has reached the right INR level,&nbsp;you still need to have a blood test once every few weeks to ensure&nbsp;your blood has stayed in the right INR range. Blood-testing clinics can be busy places and people may find it hard to fit these visits into their schedule.</p>
<p>Changing diet can change your INR. If your INR changes, you&nbsp;may need to visit the clinic more&nbsp;often until your INR returns to the&nbsp;recommended range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not everyone who takes warfarin has their INR monitored at a clinic. You can check&nbsp;your own INR levels (self-monitoring). This involves pricking a finger to get&nbsp;a drop of blood. The drop of blood is placed on a handheld electronic device which gives an INR reading. If you choose to self-monitor, you&nbsp;will&nbsp;have continuous support from health care professionals.</p>

<p>The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a small finger-shaped pouch attached to the left atrium of the heart. Nobody knows exactly what it is for. For people with atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the left atrium. These blood clots can escape from the heart and block blood vessels in the brain, causing a stroke. It is common for blood clots in the left atrium to form in this pouch. For every 100 people who get blood clots in the left atrium, 90 of them have clots found in this pouch.[<span class="referenceLink" id="referenceLink-28">28</span>]<span id="reference-28" class="content-reference">Healey JS, Crystal E, Lamy A, et al.

American Hearth Journal. 2005; 150: 288-293.</span><strong class="content-reference">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Occlusion means to block or close. Left atrial appendage occlusion is an operation that blocks the entrance to this pouch by implanting a small device. At first the device doesn't completely stop blood flowing in and out of the left atrial appendage. Within a few weeks the inner surface of the heart grows over the device, cutting it off from the rest of the heart.</p>
<p>The device consists of a metal frame covered with a plastic mesh. It is collapsible, like an umbrella. During the operation, the collapsed device is placed in the heart through a hollow tube. It is then expanded when it reaches the opening of the left atrial appendage.</p>
<p>The operation is usually done with a general anaesthetic. This means you will be asleep throughout the operation. The cardiologist (a doctor who specialises in the heart and blood vessels) inserts a small tube in your groin and feeds another thin, flexible tube up a vein until it gets to the right atrium of your heart. Using a long needle, a small hole is made in the tissue that separates the right and left atrium. The device is moved through the hollow tube to the opening of the left atrial appendage. The device is then expanded in the opening of the left atrial appendage.</p>
<p>The cardiologist can see what's going on inside the person's body using a type of x-ray machine called a fluoroscope. They may also use an ultrasound scanner that is fed into your oesophagus (gullet). The ultrasound gives a clear picture of the left atrial appendage and helps the surgeon decide the size of device that is needed.</p></div>
